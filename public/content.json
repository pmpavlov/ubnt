I’m MacDown, the open source Markdown editor for OS X. Let me introduce myself. Markdown and IMarkdown is a plain text formatting syntax created by John Gruber, aiming to provide a easy-to-read and feasible markup. The original Markdown syntax specification can be found here. MacDown is created as a simple-to-use editor for Markdown documents. I render your Markdown contents real-time into HTML, and display them in a preview panel. I support all the original Markdown syntaxes. But I can do so much more! Various popular but non-standard syntaxes can be turned on/off from the Markdown preference pane. You can specify extra HTML rendering options through the Rendering preference pane. You can customize the editor window to you liking in the Editor preferences pane: You can configure various application (that’s me!) behaviors in the General preference pane. The BasicsBefore I tell you about all the extra syntaxes and capabilities I have, I’ll introduce you to the basics of standard markdown. If you already know markdown, and want to jump straight to learning about the fancier things I can do, I suggest you skip to the Markdown preference pane. Lets jump right in. Line BreaksTo force a line break, put two spaces and a newline (return) at the end of the line. These lines won&apos;t break These lines will break Strong and EmphasizeStrong: **Strong** or __Strong__ (Command-B)Emphasize: *Emphasize* or _Emphasize_[^emphasize] (Command-I) Headers (like this one!)Header 1 ======== Header 2 -------- or # Header 1 ## Header 2 ### Header 3 #### Header 4 ##### Header 5 ###### Header 6 Links and EmailInlineJust put angle brackets around an email and it becomes clickable: &#117;&#x72;&#97;&#x6e;&#x75;&#x73;&#x6a;&#x72;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;&lt;uranusjr@gmail.com&gt; Same thing with urls: http://macdown.uranusjr.com&lt;http://macdown.uranusjr.com&gt; Perhaps you want to some link text like this: Macdown Website[Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com &quot;Title&quot;) (The title is optional) Reference styleSometimes it looks too messy to include big long urls inline, or you want to keep all your urls together. Make a link [a link][arbitrary_id] then on it’s own line anywhere else in the file:[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com &quot;Title&quot; If the link text itself would make a good id, you can link like this [like this][], then on it’s own line anywhere else in the file:[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com ImagesInline![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg &quot;Optional Title&quot;) Reference style![Alt Image Text][image-id]on it’s own line elsewhere:[image-id]: path/or/url/to.jpg &quot;Optional Title&quot; Lists Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element) Unordered lists start each item with a * - works too Indent a level to make a nested list Ordered lists are supported. Start each item (number-period-space) like 1. It doesn’t matter what number you use, I will render them sequentially So you might want to start each line with 1. and let me sort it out Here is the code: 12345678* Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)* Unordered lists start each item with a `*`- `-` works too * Indent a level to make a nested list 1.

So you might want to start each line with `1.` and let me sort it out Block Quote Angle brackets &gt; are used for block quotes.Technically not every line needs to start with a &gt; as long asthere are no empty lines between paragraphs.Looks kinda ugly though. Block quotes can be nested. Multiple Levels Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes. Lists Links Etc. Here is the code: 123456789101112&gt; Angle brackets `&gt;` are used for block quotes.

Inline CodeInline code is indicated by surrounding it with backticks:`Inline code` If your code has `backticks` that need to be displayed, you can use double backticks:``Code with `backticks` `` ```` (mind the spaces preceding the final set of backticks)1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950### Block CodeIf you indent at least four spaces or one tab, I&apos;ll display a code block. print(&apos;This is a code block&apos;) print(&apos;The block must be preceded by a blank line&apos;) print(&apos;Then indent at least 4 spaces or 1 tab&apos;) print(&apos;Nesting does nothing. Your code is displayed Literally&apos;)I also know how to do something called [Fenced Code Blocks](#fenced-code-block) which I will tell you about later.### Horizontal RulesIf you type three asterisks `***` or three dashes `---` on a line, I&apos;ll display a horizontal rule:***## &lt;a name=&quot;markdown-pane&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Markdown Preference PaneThis is where I keep all preferences related to how I parse markdown into html. ![Markdown preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/RQEi+)### Document FormattingThe ***Smartypants*** extension automatically transforms straight quotes (`&quot;` and `&apos;`) in your text into typographer’s quotes (`“`, `”`, `‘`, and `’`) according to the context. Very useful if you’re a typography freak like I am. Quote and Smartypants are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, Quote takes precedence.### Block Formatting#### TableThis is a table:First Header | Second Header------------- | -------------Content Cell | Content CellContent Cell | Content CellYou can align cell contents with syntax like this:| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned ||:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|| col 3 is | some wordy text | $1600 || col 2 is | centered | $12 || zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |The left- and right-most pipes (`|`) are only aesthetic, and can be omitted. The spaces don’t matter, either. Alignment depends solely on `:` marks.#### &lt;a name=&quot;fenced-code-block&quot;&gt;Fenced Code Block&lt;/a&gt;This is a fenced code block: print(‘Hello world!’)1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071You can also use waves (`~`) instead of back ticks (`` ` ``):~~~print(&apos;Hello world!&apos;)~~~You can add an optional language ID at the end of the first line. The language ID will only be used to highlight the code inside if you tick the ***Enable highlighting in code blocks*** option. This is what happens if you enable it:![Syntax highlighting example](http://d.pr/i/9HM6+)I support many popular languages as well as some generic syntax descriptions that can be used if your language of choice is not supported. See [relevant sections on the official site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/features/) for a full list of supported syntaxes.### Inline FormattingThe following is a list of optional inline markups supported:Option name | Markup | Result if enabled |--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|Intra-word emphasis | So A\\*maz\\*ing | So A&lt;em&gt;maz&lt;/em&gt;ing |Strikethrough | \\~~Much wow\\~~ | &lt;del&gt;Much wow&lt;/del&gt; |Underline [^under] | \\_So doge\\_ | &lt;u&gt;So doge&lt;/u&gt; |Quote [^quote] | \\&quot;Such editor\\&quot; | &lt;q&gt;Such editor&lt;/q&gt; |Highlight | \\==So good\\== | &lt;mark&gt;So good&lt;/mark&gt; |Superscript | hoge\\^(fuga) | hoge&lt;sup&gt;fuga&lt;/sup&gt; |Autolink | http://t.co | &lt;http://t.co&gt; |Footnotes | [\\^4] and [\\^4]: | [^4] and footnote 4 |[^4]: You don&apos;t have to use a number. Arbitrary things like `[^footy note4]` and `[^footy note4]:` will also work. But they will *render* as numbered footnotes. Also, no need to keep your footnotes in order, I will sort out the order for you so they appear in the same order they were referenced in the text body. You can even keep some footnotes near where you referenced them, and collect others at the bottom of the file in the traditional place for footnotes. ## &lt;a name=&quot;rendering-pane&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rendering Preference PaneThis is where I keep preferences relating to how I render and style the parsed markdown in the preview window. ![Rendering preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/rT4d+)### CSSYou can choose different css files for me to use to render your html. You can even customize or add your own custom css files.### Syntax HighlightingYou have already seen how I can syntax highlight your fenced code blocks. See the [Fenced Code Block](#fenced-code-block) section if you haven’t! You can also choose different themes for syntax highlighting.### TeX-like Math SyntaxI can also render TeX-like math syntaxes, if you allow me to.[^math] I can do inline math like this: \\\\( 1 + 1 \\\\) or this (in MathML): &lt;math&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, and block math:\\\\[ A^T_S = B\\\\]or (in MathML)&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; &lt;msubsup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msubsup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;### Task List Syntax1. [x] I can render checkbox list syntax * [x] I support nesting * [x] I support ordered *and* unordered lists2. [ ] I don&apos;t support clicking checkboxes directly in the html window### Jekyll front-matterIf you like, I can display Jekyll front-matter in a nice table. Just make sure you put the front-matter at the very beginning of the file, and fence it with `---`. For example: title: “Macdown is my friend” date: 2014-06-06 20:00:00``` Render newline literallyNormally I require you to put two spaces and a newline (aka return) at the end of a line in order to create a line break. If you like, I can render a newline any time you end a line with a newline. However, if you enable this, markdown that looks lovely when I render it might look pretty funky when you let some other program render it. The General Preferences PaneThis is where I keep preferences related to application behavior. The General Preferences Pane allows you to tell me how you want me to behave. For example, do you want me to make sure there is a document open when I launch? You can also tell me if I should constantly update the preview window as you type, or wait for you to hit command-R instead. Maybe you prefer your editor window on the right? Or to see the word-count as you type. This is also the place to tell me if you are interested in pre-releases of me, or just want to stick to better-tested official releases. The Editor Preference PaneThis is where I keep preferences related to the behavior and styling of the editing window. StylingMy editor provides syntax highlighting. You can edit the base font and the coloring/sizing theme. I provided some default themes (courtesy of Mou’s creator, Chen Luo) if you don’t know where to start. You can also edit, or even add new themes if you want to! Just click the Reveal button, and start moving things around. Remember to use the correct file extension (.styles), though. I’m picky about that. I offer auto-completion and other functions to ease your editing experience. If you don’t like it, however, you can turn them off. Hack OnThat’s about it. Thanks for listening. I’ll be quiet from now on (unless there’s an update about the app—I’ll remind you for that!). Happy writing! [^emphasize]: If Underlines is turned on, _this notation_ will render as underlined instead of emphasized [^under]: If Underline is disabled _this_ will be rendered as emphasized instead of being underlined. [^quote]: Quote replaces literal &quot; characters with html &lt;q&gt; tags. Quote and Smartypants are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, Quote takes precedence. Note that Quote is different from blockquote, which is part of standard Markdown.

Apple’s first Australian issuance came in the form of a two-part “benchmark” bond sale consisting of four- and seven-year notes, reports The Sydney Morning Herald. The publication notes price guidance of the fixed and floating rate four-year bonds is pegged at around 3 percent, while the seven-year bonds are being offered at 3.80 percent, or 0.7 percent and 1.15 percent over bank rates, respectively. Apple’s Australian bond is managed by Goldman Sachs, Commonwealth Bank and Deutsche Bank. Reports earlier this week suggested Apple’s debt offering would be land somewhere between AU$500 million and AU$1 billion. Prior to today’s bond sale, Apple notably sold debt in U.S. dollars and Euros, but has more recently taken an interest in low rate areas in Asia and Europe. For example, the company raised about $1 billion in a Swiss franc-denominated offering in February, $2 billion in yen-denominated bonds in June and another $2 billion in British pounds last month. Apple is thought to be leveraging international debt to fund its domestic capital return program. The company is slated pass $200 billion back to shareholders by the end of March 2017, but is reluctant to repatriate overseas cash due to high U.S. tax rates. Of its $220 billion cash hoard, more than $190 billion is held by offshore subsidiaries.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple outs iOS 9 Maps transit data sources, new business listing aggregators","slug":"apple-outs-ios-9-maps-transit-data-sources-new-business-listing-aggregators","date":"2015-08-18T23:39:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:22:31.000Z","comments":true,"path":"19/08/2015/apple-outs-ios-9-maps-transit-data-sources-new-business-listing-aggregators/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/19/08/2015/apple-outs-ios-9-maps-transit-data-sources-new-business-listing-aggregators/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"By AppleInsider Staff Wednesday, August 19, 2015, 04:39 pm PT (07:39 pm ET)In a change to its Apple Maps Acknowledgements webpage, Apple revealed an initial list of data providers used to populate the upcoming transit mapping feature in Maps for iOS 9, as well as two new aggregators of business listings.

Samsung said in a court filing on Wednesday that it plans to petition the Supreme Court to hear an appeal over damages awarded to Apple in the first Apple v. Samsung jury trial. The decision comes one week after the company saw its request for a full-panel CAFC rehearing shot down. Ended in 2012, the first California action left Samsung initially facing $1.05 billion in damages payments for infringing on Apple’s intellectual property, though a subsequent partial retrial and successful CAFC appeal reduced that amount to $548 million. The latest appeal has Samsung arguing against some $399 million worth of damages. In its failed attempt at a CAFC rehearing, the Korean company argued that complex electronic devices, such as smartphones or tablets, contain “hundreds or thousands of different patented technologies,” of which Apple’s asserted patents only cover minor features. The Supreme Court is Samsung’s last chance at relief, though acceptance of its petition is not guaranteed. Indeed, as noted by MacWorld, the odds are stacked against a Supreme Court showing considering the court only accepts about 75 petitions out of some 10,000 per year. A motion to take a technology patent gripe to the highest court in the land — if it is indeed heard — involves by its nature important ramifications to future patent reform and the tech sector in general. As noted by Samsung in its petition: First, the petition will present the question whether a district court must ensure, through proper claim construction and jury instructions, that a finding of design-patent infringement does not rest on unprotected functional elements of the design. Second, the petition will present the question whether an award of an infringer’s entire profits exceeds the scope of Section 289 where a patented design is only a minor feature of an infringing product. Design patent claim and construction is also being questioned, in this case as it applies to Apple’s asserted iPhone and iPad properties. As it stands, America’s labyrinthine patent system is playing no small part in complicating ongoing Apple v. Samsung proceedings, and has thus drawn an equal amount of scrutiny. Just this week, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a non-final determination invalidating design IP covering the original iPhone on multiple counts of prior art, at least two of which involved Apple’s own patents. Despite wrapping up three years ago, the first Apple v. Samsung action, and two subsequent California trials, are still slogging through the U.S. court system on multiple appeals lodged by both parties.

The company in the meantime shared a variety of details about the platform, according to PCWorld. Skylake processors will, for instance, use a technology called Speed Shift to dynamically change power state and reduce consumption. Planned performance boosts are already well-known, but one improvement will come in the form of “eDRAM+,” a fully coherent form of cache memory that can work for the CPU and not just integrated graphics. eDRAM+ will also be used in more chips than eDRAM, and in 64- and 128-megabyte sizes. A new extension technology, SGX — Software Guard eXtensions — should limit the potential damage of privileged malware attacks. Graphically, Intel claimed that Skylake’s graphics technology will be powerful enough to drive three 4K monitors at 60 hertz, versus a single 4K monitor with Broadwell chips. Skylake processors are expected to drive the next generation of Apple Macs, from the MacBook Air through to the iMac.

While not a dramatic upgrade over Yosemite, El Capitan will add niceties like Split View, enhanced Mission Control and performance improvements. Developers can download the seventh El Capitan beta via Apple’s Developer Portal or the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"MLB okays Apple Watch for use in the dugout, cell phones still banned","slug":"mlb-okays-apple-watch-for-use-in-the-dugout-cell-phones-still-banned","date":"2015-08-18T19:11:43.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:31:33.000Z","comments":true,"path":"18/08/2015/mlb-okays-apple-watch-for-use-in-the-dugout-cell-phones-still-banned/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/18/08/2015/mlb-okays-apple-watch-for-use-in-the-dugout-cell-phones-still-banned/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"By AppleInsider Staff Wednesday, August 19, 2015, 12:11 pm PT (03:11 pm ET)Major League Baseball will reportedly allow coaches and team personnel to wear Apple Watches in the dugout during games — while continuing to ban other electronic devices, including cell phones — as long as the Watch is not used for communication. The MLB home office was forced to confront the issue this week after Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost was spotted wearing his Apple Watch in the dugout during a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Yost received the Watch in question from Major League Baseball itself after managing the American League team in this year’s All-Star Game. While some overzealous publications initially reported that MLB had banned the Apple Watch after speaking with Yost, an MLB spokesperson toldMarketWatch that was not the case. The league merely checked with Yost to ensure he was not using it to access scouting data or otherwise communicate with team personnel during the game. “When you’re away from your phone, all it is is a watch,” Yost told the league, according to the Kansas City Star’s Andy McCullough. That will change with the release of watchOS 2, which will bring native apps and expanded Wi-Fi connectivity to the Watch this fall. There is no word on what MLB will do at that point, though the new capabilities may cause the Watch to fall under the league’s electronic device policy. While there is no official rule against electronic devices, then-MLB operations chief Sandy Alderson effectively laid down the law with a memo distributed in 2000: Please be reminded that the use of electronic equipment during a game is restricted. No club shall use electronic equipment, including walkie-talkies and cellular telephones, to communicate to or with any on-field personnel, including those, in the dugout, bullpen, field and-during the game-the clubhouse. Such equipment may not be used for the purpose of stealing signs or conveying information designed to give a club an advantage.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Cliick Wants App Users To Click Over Clickbait","slug":"cliick-wants-app-users-to-click-over-clickbait","date":"2015-08-18T18:04:42.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:09:31.000Z","comments":true,"path":"18/08/2015/cliick-wants-app-users-to-click-over-clickbait/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/18/08/2015/cliick-wants-app-users-to-click-over-clickbait/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Meet Cliick: another dating app wannabe, but one that’s taking a bit of a leftfield approach to the perennial problem of matching singles. Instead of proffering profiles for users to swipe through and judge, a la Tinder (and its myriad imitators) Cliick is using news stories as the swipeable connective tissue — linking users to each other when they like or discuss similar stories.The iOS app, which is currently invite-only to ensure a balanced user-base, works by asking users to specify what age-range and gender/s they would like to meet, and then drops them into a news feed where they can read, like, comment on or swipe past news articles (from the usual ‘trending content’ suspects, e.g. Upworthy, Buzzfeed, Bored Panda etc).The content each user sees is tailored to their particular interests, pulled via the app’s Facebook log-in requirement. It also uses its own learning algorithms to keep adapting the content it shows each person — so their like and dislike signals are fed back to iterate the content selection algorithm.Users that like similar stories, and also match each others’ location/age/gender requirements, will then encounter each others’ profiles via comments/likes left on stories in their mutual interest bubble. From there, they can click to view each others’ profiles, start chatting directly and see if any digital sparks result.“We are aiming to bring the real-life experience of meeting new people organically to the virtual world of mobile in a meaningful and efficient way,” Cliick’s founder Moe Rafiee tells TechCrunch.“Cliick adds context to the encounters as when a user finds another user interesting, he/she can start a conversation with the other user by replying to the comment the other user posted on a piece of content,” he adds, fleshing out the difference between Cliick and other dating apps.“In other words, the comments (and the corresponding content) act as an ice breaker and will allow a conversation to develop naturally giving users an opportunity to get to know each other a bit more and see if there is a good enough connection between them before investing time in meeting each other in person.”If the problem with snap judgement (let’s call them ‘thumb jerk’) dating apps — such as Tinder — is that they encourage singles to ‘transactionalize‘ the business of meeting a potential mate, pushing people to be overly prescriptive to speed up the profile-sorting process, while also (arguably) subtly undermining the notion of making a meaningful connection by encouraging users to keep playing their matching game (to keep them using the app), then dating apps that take a more roundabout, intentionally slower and context-sensitive approach — as Cliick is aiming to — could carve out a fan-base among singles burnt out by the Tinder thumbmill. Time will tell. Although whether clickbait can generate meaningful conversations remains to be seen. The other pertinent question here is: Will dating become just another layer applied on top of all sorts of apps? If you break dating apps down into their constituent parts they generally consist of two parts: A) matching and B) messaging. It would therefore seem a pretty trivial addition to add a ‘dating layer’ atop apps that are ostensibly focused on something other than dating. For example, a recipe app could become a way for likeminded foodies to mingle. Ditto a specialist sports or fitness app. And so on. Mobile automates the location layer so users can easily be pushed towards likeminded folk in their immediate vicinity. Their age is often given up via Facebook sign-in. The only other key question is whether someone is single or not. That data can also come via Facebook. Or it could be a simple request setting within the app — letting users specify if they want to opt into meeting other singles within their special interest group, whether that group is relating to sailing or running or cycling or whatever. If there’s an app for everything, every app could in theory offer a matchmaking layer — although apps that are focused on linking likeminded communities would seem the likeliest candidates. If you think all that sounds a bit odd, consider mobile marketplace startup Wallapop. It’s a mobile location-based flea market app which lets users buy and sell secondhand stuff in their neighborhood. That may sound inherently unsexy but the startup has experimented with matching single users wanting to meet other singles — while selling their spare bed (or whatever). Point is technology still hasn’t found a way to predict chemistry as accurately as two people actually meeting up, however fleetingly, IRL. So Wallapop giving its single users a secondary motive to get together — i.e. the chance to surreptitiously check each other out on the off-chance sparks will fly — might actually be rather smart thinking. Certainly it’s a worthy experiment. I know of one married couple who met IRL after he advertised his spare room for rent and she came to check it out, for instance. As the saying goes, love will find a way — and apps are just another communication medium that facilitates connections. So why should dating be limited to just dating apps? As for Cliick, it’s just the start for the bootstrapping startup’s dating foray. The San Francisco-based team started working on the app in March, launching it on the App Store this week — and are just firing up their marketing efforts, with a pretty standard dating app marketing plan to hire campus representatives to push the app to students, starting this fall. So their experiment to see whether clickbait can forge lasting human connections starts here. “The app is fully functional and has all the features designed. However, it currently places some users on a waitlist as they sign into the app (determined based on the user’s demographics – age, gender, location). We then give access to waitlisted users progressively to maintain a well-balanced user community,” notes Rafiee, who has a background in machine learning and data science. “We are planning to keep our waitlisting framework until the app’s user base has a reasonable size and diversity. We are hoping to get there by mid-late fall.”","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"'iPhone 6s' will move to Apple Watch's 7000-series aluminum, spectrometer analysis confirms","slug":"iphone-6s-will-move-to-apple-watchs-7000-series-aluminum-spectrometer-analysis-confirms","date":"2015-08-18T16:09:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:32:09.000Z","comments":true,"path":"18/08/2015/iphone-6s-will-move-to-apple-watchs-7000-series-aluminum-spectrometer-analysis-confirms/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/18/08/2015/iphone-6s-will-move-to-apple-watchs-7000-series-aluminum-spectrometer-analysis-confirms/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"By AppleInsider Staff Wednesday, August 19, 2015, 09:09 am PT (12:09 pm ET)Composition testing of what is purportedly a shell for Apple’s next-generation iPhone confirms previous reports that the new device will move to 7000-series aluminum, an alloy first introduced to Apple’s lineup with the Watch. The supposed iPhone 6 shell acquired by Unbox Therapy shows high concentrations of zinc, indicative of 7000-series aluminum. Generally speaking, adding zinc — along with magnesium — to create 7000-series aluminum results in an alloy that is much harder than the more popular 6000-series, and consequently more difficult to work with. When the Watch was announced, Apple proudly pointed out that the 7000-series alloy used in the sport models was in fact a custom Apple composition, though it’s still not clear exactly what they changed. It’s possible that they could’ve made concessions to make the material easier to handle during manufacturing, for instance, though they claim substantial improvements in strength. “For Apple Watch Sport, we started with 7000 Series aluminum — the same used in competition bicycles,” Apple says on its website. “We altered it to create a new alloy that’s just as light, yet even more durable — it’s 60 percent stronger than most aluminum, and one-third the density of stainless steel.” While it’s not clear whether the alloy used for the iPhone 6s will be exactly the same as the one used for the Watch, the move is likely to make the handsets much stronger. Many users have found that the smoothly-rounded corners of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are easy to dent, a charge long leveled at the also-aluminum MacBook lineup. The YouTube video also shows a “bend test” that indicates the new iPhone shell will be significantly stiffer than its predecessor, though the rig used is not a standard material deformation gauge, making the actual results of the testing somewhat questionable.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Russia's Monocrystal identified as Apple Watch sapphire supplier","slug":"russias-monocrystal-identified-as-apple-watch-sapphire-supplier","date":"2015-08-18T15:48:19.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:33:15.000Z","comments":true,"path":"18/08/2015/russias-monocrystal-identified-as-apple-watch-sapphire-supplier/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/18/08/2015/russias-monocrystal-identified-as-apple-watch-sapphire-supplier/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"By Roger Fingas Wednesday, August 19, 2015, 08:48 am PT (11:48 am ET)Apple’s scratch resistant sapphire supplier for the Apple Watch is reportedly Monocrystal, a Russian firm which has become the largest synthetic sapphire manufacturer in the world. The company’s annual revenue is up to $87 million, and it was one of the only sapphire manufacturers to post an operating profit by the end of 2014, according toSputnik News. The depreciation of the ruble in the past year — owing to falling oil prices, and economic sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine — has made it more economically competitive. Apple uses Monocrystal’s 2-inch sapphire wafers, which account for 40 percent of the latter’s output, Sputnik said. Monocrystal is reportedly looking to exploit the low ruble to boost 2-inch production from 4 million units a month to 5 million by the end of the year. It’s not clear how much of Monocrystal’s wafer production might be dedicated to Apple, as it serves a number of clients, including other watchmakers. Apple has also been vague about the number of Watch sales so far, claiming success but choosing not to publish any unit numbers or even break out revenue. Analyst estimates have varied wildly for the June quarter, anywhere between 2 million and 4.2 million.

Development studio FiftyThree’s iPad stylus is one of dozens already on the market. The analyst with KGI Securities issued a new research note on Wednesday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, in which he portrayed Force Touch input on the rumored 12.9-inch iPad as “an evolution, rather than a revolution.” According to Kuo, the new Bluetooth stylus will be sold separately from the so-called “iPad Pro.” He expects Apple to ship about a million styluses, compared to as many as 3.5 million larger iPad models. Mass production of the 12.9-inch iPad will begin in September and October, he said, with shipment presumably thereafter in time for the holiday shopping season. The analyst suggested that Cheng Uei will be the sole supplier for the stylus accessory, which would be a strange move for Apple, as the company usually diversifies its supply chain as a conservative measure. Kuo’s dismissal of Force Touch as a driver of sales is also a change for the analyst, who suggested in April that the new pressure-sensitive input method would be the most significant change to the iOS user interface ever. In fact, at the time Kuo thought Force Touch might be such a big deal that the company’s next-generation handset could be called the “iPhone 7,” rather than the “iPhone 6s.” One of Apple’s latest filings detailed an iPad stylus with extendable ‘multitouch’ nib, onboard light and motion sensors. A stylus may be necessary for Force Touch input to work on an iPad because of poor yield rates with the larger screen size, he said. “We also believe a Force Touch-enabled stylus will enhance productivity as it would offer more precise operation than using only fingers,” Kuo wrote. “Technically, we believe the stylus can be made compatible with iPad models other than the 12.9-inch version, but it depends on the support of software.” No indication was given as to how much Apple’s new stylus accessory might cost. AppleInsider’s own sources reaffirmed earlier this year that the “iPad Pro” will indeed ship with a stylus that will feature pressure sensitivity. It’s also expected that the 12.9-inch iPad will boast a USB-C connector, as well as wireless NFC connectivity, which could allow the device to be a point of sale terminal for mobile payment services like Apple Pay. In January of this year, Kuo suggested that Apple’s 2015 stylus will be a relatively simple accessory, offering more precise input than fingertips can allow. But he suggested the company may have a more advanced model, featuring 3D handwriting capabilities, in the works for release in the years to come.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple's mythical 'iPad Pro' allegedly spotted in iOS app analytics","slug":"apples-mythical-ipad-pro-allegedly-spotted-in-ios-app-analytics","date":"2015-08-18T12:45:50.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:35:15.000Z","comments":true,"path":"18/08/2015/apples-mythical-ipad-pro-allegedly-spotted-in-ios-app-analytics/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/18/08/2015/apples-mythical-ipad-pro-allegedly-spotted-in-ios-app-analytics/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"By Sam Oliver Wednesday, August 19, 2015, 05:45 am PT (08:45 am ET)A new, high-resolution iPad with an as-yet-unseen model identifier has reportedly begun to surface in analytics data from some commercial iOS apps, suggesting that the long-rumored “iPad Pro” may have entered the later stages of testing.

Wristly aggregated data from an “Inner Circle” of more than 1,000 Apple Watch owners in the U.S. and UK — the only regions with official Apple Pay support — and published its findings on Tuesday. The 80 percent statistic is in stark contrast to — highly questionable — surveys claiming Apple Pay usage rates are in the low teens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners, Wristly says. Of the roughly 20 percent of respondents that don’t use Apple Pay on Watch, 5 percent said they “do not perceive a benefit” from Apple Pay, 5 percent have security concerns and 15 are using other methods of payment. Unsurprisingly, most respondents who use Apple Pay first tried the service with an iPhone, though a fairly substantial 19 percent reported their first experience was on Apple Watch. The number is interesting considering Pay debuted six months prior to Watch’s release. One theory addressing the high adoption rate is that using Watch is more intuitive than pulling out an iPhone. More than half of respondents described paying with Watch a “magical” user experience, while 42 percent said the process is convenient. Only 4 percent found Pay on Watch “not that useful” and 3 percent had concerns about security. Aside from high adoption rates, Watch owners who do use Apple Pay seem to be dedicated to Apple’s touchless payments platform. The report says 78 percent of users who set up Apple Pay on their Watch use it at least once a week, a metric up 13 percent from June. Some 15 percent of users claim to use Watch and Apple Pay at least once per day. That Apple Pay adoption is so high on Watch may not come as a surprise given device owners are likely deeply entrenched in Apple’s hardware and software ecosystem. The dynamic might help give merchants not yet on board with Apple’s payment initiative that extra push, as Wristly notes 62 percent of panelists shopped at a specific retailer based in part on its decision to support Apple Pay. Further, 86 percent of respondents are actively seeking out Apple Pay branding materials at point of sale terminals, suggesting high brand loyalty.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Parallels Desktop 11 launches with support for El Capitan, Windows 10, Cortana and more","slug":"parallels-desktop-11-launches-with-support-for-el-capitan-windows-10-cortana-and-more","date":"2015-08-18T04:01:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"18/08/2015/parallels-desktop-11-launches-with-support-for-el-capitan-windows-10-cortana-and-more/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/18/08/2015/parallels-desktop-11-launches-with-support-for-el-capitan-windows-10-cortana-and-more/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"As anticipated, Parallels on Wednesday released Parallels Desktop 11, the latest version of its virtualization software that comes with a slew of improvements, the most notable being support for Microsoft Windows 10 and major features like the Cortana virtual assistant. Prior to today’s launch AppleInsider was given a sneak peek at some of Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac’s top features and came away impressed with the improvements made since last year. For example, the new version comes with full integration of Microsoft’s always-on Cortana virtual assistant, support for Force Touch gestures across both operating systems and user experience improvements and a litany of evolutionary UI changes. With Siri not yet available on OS X, it’s no surprise that support for Cortana is being billed as one of this year’s top features. Using the Parallels Audio Controller, users can invoke Microsoft’s virtual assistant from any app, even when Windows 10 is populating the active window. Cortana uses voice recognition and natural language processing to answer queries ranging from weather status to universal system search and beyond. With Parallels Desktop 11 users can even launch Mac apps with the service. During the presentation Cortana took a bit of coaxing to work properly (it didn’t recognize the “Hey Cortana” voice trigger), but the functionality should be seamlessly integrated by today’s release. Also new is the ability to view Windows documents with Mac’s Quick Look feature. On that topic, Force Touch gesture integration available with the latest MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops can be used to invoke Quick Look and dictionary lookup in both operating environments. A built-in Travel Mode automatically adjusts virtual machine settings to use as little power as possible, boosting battery life by as much as 25 percent. Network settings are also toggled to shared networking, in which Windows programs hop on a Mac’s connection, for ease of use. The latest version includes a dedicated Coherence button located at the top of every open window, granting quick and seamless access to Windows 10 assets like Action Center. A related feature automatically detects what app — Windows or Mac — is being used to open a file and, if the software is not a registered default, asks whether to always associate the file type with that program. Previously, users had to manually change this setting via the “Open With” option in Mac’s “Get Info” pane. Other improvements include native Windows print page setup from OS X, location services support, volume control synchronization, “Open in Windows”right click menu option, “Open in IE” plug-in and a recently used files list pulled from Mac, virtual machine or the cloud. A full list of additions is available at Parallels.com. Finally, Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac sports built-in support for Apple’s upcoming OS X 10.11 El Capitan as either a host or guest operating system. Full integration notes have yet to be released as El Capitan is still in beta testing. Performance enhancements: Boot time and shut down time can be as much as 50 percent faster for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 ￼Battery life is extended up to 25 percent Tasks in Windows up to 20 percent faster ￼Moving files between Mac and Windows up to 5 percent faster Virtual machines suspend up to 20 percent faster For developers and IT professionals, Parallels is introducing a new subscription tier called Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac Pro Edition, which offers additional user tools and enhanced performance. Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac Pro Edition offers: Integration with key developer tools, such as Docker, Visual Studio (plug-in), Chef and Jenkins Support for Vagrant and other developer tools Additional user profiles for developers, power users and testers for optimal configuration for their particular scenarios Advanced networking tools and configuration for virtual networks to test complex networking scenarios, including the ability to simulate some network instabilities Cloud storage access through Box.net, Dropbox for Business and OneDrive Business, for sharing from Windows to Mac Headless mode for running virtual machines in the background without user interface Ability to create linked clones to conserve disk space and optimize installations Enhanced memory (64 GB RAM) and processing power (16 vCPU) for improved performance Nested virtualization for Linux guests Modern.IE test environments in the Parallels New Virtual Machine Wizard provide access to free trials of browsers for testing 24/7 phone and email support Current users of Parallels Desktop 9 and 10 can upgrade to Parallels Desktop 11 today for $49.99, or choose an introductory offer to upgrade to a Parallels Desktop for Mac Pro Edition subscription for $49.99 per year.

Apple provided the correct Apple Music numbers to The Verge shortly after the MusicWatch survey was released on Tuesday. Specifically, Apple said 79 percent of people who signed up for a three-month free trial are still active users. The admonition brings into question other data from today’s report. According to survey respondents, 64 percent said they were extremely or very likely to continue paying for Apple Music once the trial period ends, though 61 percent already turned off auto-renewal features in iTunes. Perhaps most damning was a statistic claiming 48 percent of users who tried Apple Music since its debut in June had stopped using the service. Apple stopped short of offering in-depth statistics or analysis and it is unclear how the company defines active users. The 79 percent number also sheds no light on potential conversion rates, or those who intend to pay for Apple Music services after their trial period expires. At the same time, MusicWatch’s survey results regarding the percentage of customers who turned off auto-renewal is slightly misleading. That a customer opts out of automated renewal service does not necessarily serve as an indication of that person’s intent to subscribe, they might simply be averse to such billing systems. What Apple’s statement makes clear, however, is that research reports drawing from customer surveys can at times be completely off target. Or at least inconsistent in interpreting gathered data. Only Apple knows how well Apple Music is fairing in a field full of strong competitors, though even it can’t predict what subscription numbers will be like in September with any certainty. So far, Apple is playing its music streaming cards close to the vest, only revealing earlier this month that 11 million users had signed up for trial accounts five weeks in.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Fossil joins Apple Watch competition with Moto 360-like Android Wear product","slug":"fossil-joins-apple-watch-competition-with-moto-360-like-android-wear-product","date":"2015-08-17T21:11:45.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"17/08/2015/fossil-joins-apple-watch-competition-with-moto-360-like-android-wear-product/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/17/08/2015/fossil-joins-apple-watch-competition-with-moto-360-like-android-wear-product/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"–A+ By Roger Fingas Tuesday, August 18, 2015, 02:11 pm PT (05:11 pm ET)Presenting Tuesday at the annual Intel Developer Forum, fashion brand Fossil teased its first competitor to the Apple Watch, a device that will run Google’s Android Wear platform.

The device will also offer a silver finish and multiple bands, photos from Engadgetindicate. These include leather and metal link options. A full product announcement, including pricing, should happen in coming months. The smartwatch market has so far been dominated by technology companies such as Apple, Garmin, Pebble, Motorola, and Samsung. Traditional watch companies are only beginning to enter the field, in some cases out of concern that the Apple Watch could eat into low- to mid-range sales. Fossil’s product may be more directly aimed at competing with Apple than others, given the choice of materials and its current conventional options costing less than $1,000.

But the company also acknowledged that its Project Ara modular smartphone won’t reach the public until at least 2016. The OnHub — built in partnership with router maker TP-LINK — employs an unusual cylindrical design, hiding 13 antennas inside its frame. It also replaces a router’s standard set of LEDs with a single ring light that shows one of four colors to indicate device status. The device supports speeds up to 1.9 gigabits per second, and can operate on 2.4 and 5 gigahertz frequencies. The best channel is selected automatically during setup, and the router’s software will continually adjust settings to try to avoid interference. If needed, connected devices can be prioritized to maximize their bandwidth. Setup and management is handled almost entirely through an app for iOS and Android, Google On. The tool monitors network traffic, performs tests, and will offer suggestions if it detects a problem. It also displays a router’s password “with a single tap,” according to Google, and makes it easy to share via text or email. The router has 4 gigabytes of onboard storage and is set to automatically update with new features and security patches. It’s also said to be future-proof in terms of standards, being compatible with Weave, 802.15.4, and Bluetooth Smart Ready. And in an addition that pits it against the Apple TV, OnHub will also control smart home devices that support Bluetooth Smart Ready, Google’s Weave, or the 802.15.4 standard. The Apple TV, meanwhile, wirelessly controls HomeKit compatible accessories when a user is away from home. The OnHub can be preordered for $200, either directly from Google or from other online sources like Amazon. Google said it is working on more OnHub devices with other manufacturers, including one from ASUS that should be announced later this year.

The company is now “looking at a few locations in the U.S.” for 2016, although last week it suggested that it’s not abandoning Puerto Rico entirely. The Ara concept would allow smartphone owners to upgrade individual components of their device, rather than having to pay hundreds of dollars to replace everything. Although Google showed off a working prototype at its May Google I/O conference, no commercial products have been announced.

Having a gifted technical mind himself, currently doing double duty as Hipmunk’s CTO, the need for a technical lead at Reddit was glaring.Today, the company has announced that it has hired founding engineer at Pinterest, Marty Weiner, as its first CTO in company history. Weiner spent over four and a half years at Pinterest, telling us that he and Pinterest’s CEO, Ben Silbermann, have been hacking together since way before Pinterest was started. With Pinterest prepping for a potential public market debut at some point, we think, Weiner has stepped away and into a new role that is indeed a challenge.In an email to TechCrunch, Weiner calls this the “hardest decision of my life” but that it was time to move on to something new. His list of things to tackle consist of building an engineering culture that will help with recruiting, expanding diversity and scaling Reddit’s current infrastructure and processes.Choosing not to discuss Reddit’s recent community and executive issues, Weiner says he is focused on the future and “helping grow an already amazing team and building amazing tech.”Reddit is just as excited to have him, as co-founder Alexis Ohanian told us:&gt; As the founding engineer + architect of Pinterest, Marty’s experience, leadership, and ability speaks for itself. With all the opportunities in the world open to him, we’re amped to work with him to take Reddit to new heights.Weiner’s history with that team includes being introduced to Ohanian through his brother, eventually meeting regularly for coffee. Admittedly, he’s still getting to know Huffman, who tells us:&gt; Engineering is Reddit’s largest team, and in order to build everything we’d like, we will need as many engineers and as much leadership as possible. He (Weiner) is supremely talented technically, deeply understands Reddit, and not only has a clear vision for how to build out the team–he has done it before.I asked a few folks about Weiner and his technical chops, and was told by a few of them to check out one of his “Scaling Pinterest” presentations that he gave over the better part of a year. It’s definitely worth the watch: This is the type of approach that Reddit, which had over 195M unique visitors last month making it the #10 most trafficked site in the US (Pinterest is in the 16th spot), clearly needed. Not having an official CTO for ten years is pretty unheard of. He says his goal is to build, as he calls it, the “dream machine”: ….an engineering org and tech stack that makes any new product idea at Reddit prototypable and shippable faster and better with every passing month. If Weiner can successfully wade through the community mess that the rest of the executives can now focus on, there’s no telling what Reddit can evolve into from a technical perspective. Maybe it’ll even get a redesign one day… …probably not.Featured Image: evablue/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Fig Lets You Crowdfund Computer Games For Profit, Not Just Fun","slug":"fig-lets-you-crowdfund-computer-games-for-profit-not-just-fun","date":"2015-08-17T14:02:15.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:11:12.000Z","comments":true,"path":"17/08/2015/fig-lets-you-crowdfund-computer-games-for-profit-not-just-fun/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/17/08/2015/fig-lets-you-crowdfund-computer-games-for-profit-not-just-fun/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"A conspiracy has been hatched by the world’s top Triple-A and indie developers to change the way computer games are financed. It’s called Fig. It’s a highly curated reward and equity crowdfunding funding platform just for games.Each month, Fig will debut one major studio title and one independent release, and already has campaigns lined up from lauded studios like Obsidian Entertainment, inXile Entertainment and Double Fine. Fans can fund games to earn traditional rewards like downloadable content or a chance to meet the developer.But if developers want, they can allow “accredited investors” with net worths over $1 million to invest at least $1,000 in exchange for a share of the game’s revenue. Eventually, Fig hopes to employ the JOBS Act crowdfunding regulation to let anyone, not just the very rich, invest in games for equity.Today Fig launches with a campaign to raise $125,000 for Outer Wilds, the unfinished game that won the 2015 Independent Games Festival Awards’ Grand Prize. If you know the Bill Murray film Groundhog Day (or Tom Cruise’s Edge Of Tomorrow), this first-person adventure game is a lot like that. Save the world before you die, or wake up at the start of the same day and try again with newfound knowledge.Rewards range from $20 for a copy of the game to $10,000 for an IRL adventure with the game’s developer Mobius Digital’s team including TV show Heroes’ star Masi Oka. But starting at $1,000, people can also invest for equity in the game and earn money if it’s a hit.Here’s a video announcing Outer Wilds on Fig:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ytvzNlmRo## Why Ditch Kickstarter?Because games are outgrowing one-size-fits-all crowdfunding sites. One game called Star Citizen raised $2 million on Kickstarter before going on to raise a whopping $85 million more on its own website where it had more control over the funding.Fig CEO Justin Bailey Fig CEO and “Psychonauts” game studio Double Fine COO Justin Bailey tells me “The current leading platforms, they’re meant to be everything to all different industries. The campaign structure has to work as well for taxidermy as it does for $5 million video games.” So Bailey raised funding from Spark Capital and assembled a team of advisors from the leaders of crowdfunded gaming. Those include Feargus Urquhart of Fallout developer Obsidian, Wasteland 2 developer inXile’s Brian Fargo, and Tim Schafer from Bailey’s company Double Fine, which made Brutal Legend. Together, they built Fig, which is named after the Hotel Figuroa in LA where developers stay for the E3 gaming conference. Bailey tells me he “ran [Fig] by the top 10 game developers on Kickstarter and they’re for it.” So how exactly is it different? Fig has a dark theme like Steam, where many of the games it funds might eventually be sold. It’s aggressively curated so you only see high-potential titles. It’s built around a development timeline that lets backers know how far along the game is. Fans can easily assemble bundles of different digital content rewards. And if they upload the necessary documents and legal info and put in at least $1,000, they can earn money if the game does. For comparison, Kickstarter is overrun by games so it’s tough to know what’s worth funding. Cobbling together digital content bundles is awkward, discouraging pledges. And Kickstarter doesn’t offer equity crowdfunding. At its core, Fig is designed for flexibility, and can mold to the games it hosts. The risk is that without the Kickstarter or Indiegogo brand name, Fig might see less traffic. But Bailey insists that “97% of traffic coming into a crowdfunding campaign comes from the creators”, and since these developers have cult followings, getting games in front of potential backers shouldn’t be too tough. Outer Wilds screenshot Fig could provide a more reliable way to invest in games. Funding whole studios can be dicey, because it’s tough to know if they’ll strike gold again and successfully follow up on a past blockbuster.

When the user tapped on certain words in the message, they would appear and disappear again as the user’s finger moved across the entire message.Once the user chose to reply or exit out, the message disappeared forever.Now, that same functionality is coming over to the Desktop for both Mac and Windows as a native application.Founder and CEO Jon Brod told TechCrunch that desktop functionality was always part of the plan.“We want to offer private, self-destructing messages across all platforms and all devices,” said Brod. “These days, everyone needs privacy, and we want to be the ubiquitous platform for that level of secure and private communication.”With the desktop version of the app, one of the biggest challenges was developing software that would eliminate the ability to take screenshots of messages. For Mac, users who try to screenshot a Confide message will simply see a blank, gray screen, and the same is true for Windows, except that the file will show a black screen instead. Confide already has a mobile app, and recently introduced an Apple Watch app, as well. That said, notifications won’t be hitting all of your devices all the time. Instead, Confide will recognize when you’re actively using the desktop app and/or mobile app and send notifications to the appropriate destination. If you haven’t read a message on desktop for a while, Confide will send a delayed notification to your phone to make sure you receive the message. Just as is the case with Confide for mobile, the desktop app also allows users to send files and photos which are viewable only one portion at a time. 1. confide-mac-screenshot-1&lt;div/&gt; 2. confide-mac-screenshot-2&lt;div/&gt; 3. confide-windows-app-icon&lt;div/&gt; 4. confide-windows-screenshot-1&lt;div/&gt; 5. confide-windows-screenshot-2&lt;div/&gt; View SlideshowPreviousNextExit The main difference between mobile and desktop is that received desktop messages don’t self-destruct until after the reply message is sent.

Live streaming video startup founder Ben Rubin has participated, so has Mattermark’s Danielle Morrill and even rapper Snoop Dogg engaged with the audience in a Product Hunt AMA for the launch of his latest album.However, the LIVE section will be something that is scheduled out and not necessarily around a product launch. “It’s to highlight makers and what they are doing,” Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover told TechCrunch over the phone.Makers will go on the LIVE section of the site from Monday through Friday (and on the weekend occasionally) to converse with the Product Hunt community and answer questions about their products, solicit feedback and tell their story.The idea for LIVE hung there for a while, but Product Hunt’s Erik Torenberg convinced the team to push it forward, according to Hoover. “It’s something we talked about months ago. Eric brought it up because he kept seeing it mentioned with books and other things. We decided it was a good idea to have a section like this,” Hoover said.Product Hunt has already scheduled more than 100 people for LIVE in the coming weeks. The list includes familiar tech leaders like Aileen Lee, Ben Horowitz, Jessica Livingston and Dave McClure, but also those with more of a celebrity cache such as Amanda Palmer, Ashton Kutcher and BJ Novak.Adam Lisagor, founder of Sandwich Video, which makes a lot of the startup commercials for companies like Slack and Robinhood, will be on LIVE today as the first to go on.But the LIVE feature isn’t just for high-profile people, according to Hoover. It will be for gamers, book authors, and for “anyone building something cool,” Hoover said. He hopes to see more interesting and serendipitous conversations come about on the site through LIVE – but especially between the tech community and those outside of tech. This is something Product Hunt is striving to do as it grows. The platform has already added games and books sections in an attempt to grow beyond its core startup audience. Hoover mentioned mid-western car salesman Jesiah Bonney as someone he’d like to highlight in a LIVE discussion on the site. Bonney doesn’t have much to do with the tech scene, but he has a knack for making stop-motion videos and other entertaining bits on Hoover’s favorite social video platform Mindie. “I would love to bring more attention to his talent,” Hoover told me. “Car sales are obviously not his passion. I told him, you’ve got to find a way to make what you love a part of your life.” There are a lot of similarities between Reddit and Product Hunt – including upvoting and AMAs. Reddit’s more popular AMA’s also included Snoop Dogg. Hoover acknowledges the comparison but pointed out that the audiences are different on each platform. “Even if the products were identical you’d get a different experience in each AMA because of the audience,” Hoover said. Reddit has been criticized for indulging hate speech and trolling in threads over the years. However, the site billed as the “front page of the Internet” recently started to hide and/or ban some of the more unsavory topics on the site. Product Hunt’s audience is generally positive. People ask questions about posted products they’ve upvoted or want to know more about. But the tech scene seems more positive to me than other sections in general (feel free to disagree). It will be interesting to see how the LIVE feature turns out as Product Hunt introduces more people beyond those in the startup world.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Whim Is A Dating App Focused On Actual Dates","slug":"whim-is-a-dating-app-focused-on-actual-dates","date":"2015-08-17T13:16:48.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:16:46.000Z","comments":true,"path":"17/08/2015/whim-is-a-dating-app-focused-on-actual-dates/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/17/08/2015/whim-is-a-dating-app-focused-on-actual-dates/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"There’s a new service called Whim for people who are tired of all the chatting in the current batch of dating apps.To be sure, there are other online dating services that purport to focus on making real-world connections (rather than hosting awkward, back-and-forth messaging sessions that may or may not lead to actual dates or hookups) — that’s basically the reason HowAboutWe, which was acquired by IAC last year, exists.But Whim is particularly absolutist in its approach to setting up actual dates. Users create profiles and specify the days when they’re free. Then they can browse other users and identify the ones they want to meet.As soon as two people have expressed interest in each other, the service will go ahead and set up a time and place for the date, based on your availability and preferences (like whether or not you drink alcohol). You can still message one other about logistics (using your real phone numbers, by the way), but that’s no longer required before you set up a date.Founder and CEO Eve Peters said the company surveyed the users of online dating apps and found that matches resulted in dates less than 10 percent of the time. In contrast, among early Whim users, matches resulted in dates more than 90 percent of the time.Of course, this approach sets the bar higher for that initial match, making users think harder before they swipe right. You can’t just say that you like everyone, start a dozen chats and pick the ones you’re willing to meet.Peters argued that this turns swiping right into a “meaningful action” again, but she also acknowledged that it can also result in users who are just constantly turned down.“Unfortunately, as is the case with any dating app and with real-life dating situation, some people are more successful than others,” Peters said. She added that Whim hopes to increase the likelihood of users going on dates as the user base grows and the app gets smarter about which users should get shown to whom. Another issue is safety. Awkward as it can be, I’d imagine that the message-before-meeting process does provide something of a filter for creeps. On a basic level, it helps that Whim’s dates are all set up in public places. And Peters said the service relies on “high human touch” to do some of the same filtering. That starts with the profile creation process — every profile gets read by a Whim team member, who tries to catch “anything unsavory.” The team also reaches out for post-date feedback, so anyone who’s horrible or just a flake should get flagged and removed fairly quickly. The service is currently free. Peters said she plans to charge $10 a month, with the first date remaining free and additional incentives for recommending the service to your friends. The app could also make money through promotional deals with the bars, restaurants and other businesses where it sets up dates. Peters, by the way, has been in the online dating business for a while. She previously founded the group dating startup Mixtt, which launched at TechCrunch50, and worked at OkCupid Labs. So it’s no surprise that she read that Vanity Fair piece about online dating. ## Related ArticlesThe New HowAboutWe Will Let You Order A Date On Demand500 Startups Accelerator Announces Its Tenth Batch Of Companies “The main points of it about the overabundance of choice and people’s reluctance to commit to one person, all of that resonated as very true,” she said. “From the perspective of being Whim’s founder, we think in a lot of ways, Whim can be antidote to what people are experiencing on Tinder … This is for people seriously looking to connect in real life.”The service was incubated at 500 Startups and is currently available in the San Francisco Bay Area, with plans to launch in its next city (probably Los Angeles) by the end of the year. You can download the iOS app here. Peters said an Android version will probably launch in 2016.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Square Cash Launches Apple Watch App Just In Case You Have Money Left After Buying The Apple Watch","slug":"square-cash-launches-apple-watch-app-just-in-case-you-have-money-left-after-buying-the-apple-watch","date":"2015-08-17T13:00:58.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:15:06.000Z","comments":true,"path":"17/08/2015/square-cash-launches-apple-watch-app-just-in-case-you-have-money-left-after-buying-the-apple-watch/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/17/08/2015/square-cash-launches-apple-watch-app-just-in-case-you-have-money-left-after-buying-the-apple-watch/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"I don’t carry cash anymore.

Now they can with The Ticket Fairy, a full-stack events marketing and analytics suite coming out of stealth from Y Combinator today.The Ticket Fairy’s goal is to make sure all its clients’ events sell out. Promoters let The Ticket Fairy sell their tickets, run their analytics, and handle ad buying in exchange for a fee on each ticket sold.The startup sells 100 percent of an event’s inventory when it can, but sometimes exclusivity contracts with ticketers like TicketMaster mean it can only sell the 20 percent that a promoter has the right to distribute on its own. Eventually, though, co-founders Ritesh and Jigar Patel say The Ticket Fairy hopes to earn promoters so much money that they ditch their contracts and sell everything through its platform.Ritesh built The Ticket Fairy to solve his own problems after running more than 400 events since 2000. Now it’s handled over $3.2 million in ticket sales, mostly for concerts, but it’s also breaking into big eSports competitions.Ticket Fairy offers four central tools, but it’s building more: Referral Marketing – When people buy tickets through The Ticket Fairy, they get a personalized referral URL they can easily share via Facebook message or post, WhatsApp, Twitter, or however they want. When others buy through the referral link, the original person gets cash paid back to their credit card. No codes or sign-ups necessary. It’s more cost-effective than ads, and Ritesh tells me the incentive produces “crazy return on investment. For every dollar they give, they earn $30 in extra revenue.” Demographic Insights – During the ticket buying process, The Ticket Fairy tries to collect as much info as possible on the customer, including Facebook profile access that unlocks age, gender, and interests, plus Spotify listening history and other data. It uses this info to deliver audience intelligence to the client. For example, The Ticket Fairy could tell a music festival which bands to book based on who their existing customers Like. Sales Attribution – The Ticket Fairy tracks where every purchase comes from to make sure marketing dollars are spent efficiently. It could show that ads or a partnership were performing poorly, but that a random music blogger was driving tons of sales. That way the promoter could try to run a campaign on that blog. Ad Management – To tie everything together, clients have the option of The Ticket Fairy running their ad campaigns. By using all its data on referrals, customers, and traffic sources, it can intelligently allocate ad spend to the channels that are delivering the most sales per dollar spent. Right now, The Ticket Fairy does this for free, but eventually it wants to earn a small management fee, So if it lowered a client’s ad spend by 40% while boosting sales, it could take a cut of the savings.If The Ticket Fairy can consistently sell more tickets on less marketing spend, promoters will happily adopt it. It’s a similar strategy to some of the event marketing and analytics tools that EventBrite and TicketFly have launched over the years. But those platforms want you to sell 100 percent of your tickets through them, which isn’t always convenient, and they lack features of The Ticket Fairy’s dedicated tool. The Patel boys’ startup will have to compete with EventKloud, Eventgrid, and other wide-reaching services. But they often require upfront subscriptions or seem outdated for the mobile and social channels where events are shared today. It also might face direct-to-fan ticketing platforms like Applauze and Songkick, which recently merged with CrowdSurge. The Ticket Fairy’s biggest challenge, though, may simply be getting access to ticket inventory for great events. That’s what stumped WillCall and led it to get bought by TicketFly. Exclusivity contracts lock up a lot of traditional concerts and sporting events with established ticketers. The Ticket Fairy’s best bet might be fighting for non-standard events like conferences and esports. Ticket Fair co-founders Jigar and Ritesh Patel [from left]Luckily, the startup has raised $485,000 from angels including Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, co-founder Justin Kan, COO Kevin Lin, and head of music Colin Carrier, who could certainly help it become the premier ticketing platform for esports events. It’s also taken money from FarmVille creator Amitt Mahajan, Reddit and Hipmunk founder Steve Huffman, Y Combinator, and 500 Startups’ Seed Fund.We’re amid a shift to the experiential culture. More and more, people want to do things, not own them. We have event discovery apps to find experiences, camera phones to capture them, and social networks to share them.

Its bare-bones blogging feature launched in 2006 as a place for writing missives that wouldn’t fit in a status update. After a few tweaks like the ability to insert photos, Facebook left Notes to languish.The launch of Timeline in 2011 buried the feature so deep in the interface that one could conclude Facebook didn’t want to deal with Notes any more. It seemed like people were satisfied with short-form social media posts, and few needed a place for long-form blogging.But then there was Medium. Launched in late 2012, it’s slowly gained steam to become THE place for infrequent bloggers, touchy-feely corporate responses, journalistic experiments, and all kinds of thinkfluenceship. Meanwhile, Tumblr was maturing from quick GIF reblogs by scene kids to a legitimate blogging platform under its new owner Yahoo.Facebook needed to wake up. The mainstream was ready to blog, and they didn’t want to set up a whole custom website to do it. In 2013, I wrote a stern call to arms for Facebook to overhaul Notes with three objectives: Make Notes simple enough for anyone to use Give Notes enough amplification in the News Feed to draw big audiences that people already have on Facebook but that are hard to build from scratch elsewhere* Design Notes to be classy enough that thought leaders want to use itLater that year, I heard rumor of one wily Facebook engineer hellbent on getting the company to revamp Notes. Apparently Facebook listened.Now, Facebook is testing a design update to Notes that makes it much simpler and classier looking. Spotted by David Winer and reported by Mic Wright at The Next Web, it features nearly full-width images without cluttered sidebars, and allows for big, beautiful cover images like Facebook profiles. Facebook told The Next Web “We’re testing an update to Notes to make it easier for people to create and read longer-form stories on Facebook.”Here’s the old Notes design with gaudy (though useful) sidebars:—Here’s the new simple and classy Notes without the sidebar:—And here’s a Medium post featuring a similar design: The new Notes certainly looks comprehensible to Internet n00bs, but slick enough that you could imagine venture capitalists or heads of state publishing on it. [Update: That’s an improvement on most of free blogging behemoths like WordPress that can show ads amongst your content and take work to make pretty…which is why people are moving to cleaner blogging pastures.] The real question, though, is whether Facebook is willing to put the power of the feed behind it. The core problem with Medium is that it relies largely on Twitter for distribution. Medium was started by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. For high-minded thinkfluenceship (blogging to grow and show off one’s influence), that works fine. But Twitter’s still working towards ubiquity with Averages Joes. Tumblr similarly still has a bit of a niche, unruly feel, purported by its esoteric fandoms and off-kilter porn. Facebook’s advantage is its distribution. The same weapon it’s used to barge into web publishing with Instant Articles and video hosting with its auto-play clips could help it invade blogging. It’s similar to how LinkedIn used its natural traffic to launch a professional-minded publishing network. People will write where they get an audience. If that’s Facebook, they’ll publish there. And while Twitter doesn’t discriminate, showing every post to everyone, Facebook’s filtered feed shows you what it thinks you’ll actually consume. That led to a quick shift from people and businesses on Facebook sharing links out to YouTube to them sharing native Facebook videos because they’re easier to watch on Facebook, so more people engage with them, so the feed shows them to more people. The same could happen to blogging. If you can share a Facebook Note’s link anywhere just like a Medium link, but you’ll get extra eyeballs on Facebook for writing with its platform, it could be a big draw for bloggers. All Facebook has to do is make the on-Facebook reading experience of Notes better than clicking out to read a blog elsewhere. Just as with Instant Articles for publishers like BuzzFeed and the New York Times, Facebook could prep Notes so they’re immediately readable when discovered in the News Feed without waiting for a mobile site to load. And with the new design now in testing, people will get a smooth reading experience once they open a Note. It’s just another step in Facebook’s “Quest To Absorb The Internet.”","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Twitter’s MoPub Sees Big Growth In Native Ads","slug":"twitters-mopub-sees-big-growth-in-native-ads","date":"2015-08-16T16:05:13.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:16:12.000Z","comments":true,"path":"16/08/2015/twitters-mopub-sees-big-growth-in-native-ads/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/16/08/2015/twitters-mopub-sees-big-growth-in-native-ads/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Twitter-owned mobile ad exchange MoPub is releasing some new numbers about the growth of native advertising.Native advertising is a fuzzy term, but it usually refers to ads that have been customized to resemble editorial or user content.

Once it’s unlocked, any employee using the app can share it more broadly. Employees can also upload content that’s only meant for sharing within the company, upvote the photos and videos they think are best and can compete for the top spot on company leaderboards. ## Related ArticlesFollowing Merger With Addvocate, Trapit Launches A Combined Product For Social SharingMarketing Startup Percolate Raises $40M More Now, if you’re not interested in turning your social media accounts into a promotional vehicle for your employer, well, employees have a say in whether or not they want to share (though I suppose a particularly cruel boss might make it mandatory).

He’s been plenty busy since he got started, including launching Buyable Pins. We sat down with him to find out a little bit more about the company’s commerce plans. “It is tempting to draw a buy button on a product and say you’ve enabled commerce,” Kendall said. “In our case we feel like we’ve built the full end-to-end capability. We now offer 2.5 million products that are buyable.” Kendall said, with the buy button, the company has essentially captured all parts of the marketing funnel — from awareness and intent all the way to the purchase. The company has products that sync up with all of these, ranging from ads like cinematic pins, to guided search and finally a buy button. Buyable Pins launched in June earlier this year, giving partners a way to add a button to buy things directly from Pinterest. It’s working with a small number of partners at launch, but merchants can also use Shopify and Demandware. Buyable Pins started rolling out on the iPhone and iPad in late June. Kendall was at Facebook for more than four years helping the company build its original ad products, and then helped Tumblr design their ad system. He’s been at Pinterest for the past three and a half years. Kendall met with CEO Ben Silbermann, who told him that he wanted to do for discovery “what Google did for search.” And earlier this year he took over the role of GM of monetization, where he got Buyable Pins off the ground. “I had this experience as a kid with the Sharper Image — when i was a kid there was no Internet,” he said. “My window to the outside world was an encyclopedia and TV, I suppose. But I remember [The Sharper Image] coming and it being almost this religious experience.

Co-founder and CEO Steve El-Hage (pictured above) said the oldest communities (namely, the ones for audiophiles and for fans of mechanical keyboards) are the most popular, if only because they’ve had a head start. Massdrop says it now has a registered user base of more than 1 million people.El-Hage plans to launch four new communities before the end of the year, and then add a new community every month in 2016. He’s also hoping to offer more content, such as in-depth reviews or do-it-yourself explainers. To do that, he’ll find people online “who have expert knowledge but no following.”“There’s a lot of awesome content being written in each category that’s not being surfaced or matched with appropriate viewers,” he said.Naturally, El-Hage thinks Massdrop is the place where those experts can find the audience they’ve been looking for. As for whether Massdrop’s commerce business will make it hard for those writers to be critical and honest, El-Hage said he’s more focused on building community than on driving sales. “Our goal isn’t to sell them anything, even though we love it when we do,” he said. He also pointed to Amazon, which has no problem running one-star reviews next to the products it’s selling. Massdrop raised a $6.5 million Series A about a year ago.The new round was led by August Capital, with additional investment from First Round Capital, Mayfield Fund and Cowboy Ventures. August’s David Hornik is joining Massdrop’s board of directors. “Many companies have found initial success in e-commerce, but hit a plateau where they can no longer drive growth through paid acquisition alone,” Hornik said in the funding release. “By fostering and engaging the community, rather than buying one, Massdrop has pushed through this plateau and continues to grow its user base.” ## Related ArticlesMassdrop Raises $6.5M To Turn Group Buying Into A Broader Community PlatformBaidu To Invest $3.2 Billion In Its Group-Buying Service Nuomi To the outside eye, the communities that Massdrop has established so far might seem a bit random — unless you see a connection between quilting and ultralight outdoor gear that I’m missing.Apparently the categories don’t necessarily reflect all of El-Hage’s personal interests, although he said that when the team decides to move into a new area, he tries to immerse himself in that world. For example, when Massdrop was getting ready to move into ultralight gear, El-Hage said he “hopped on a plane, drove to Canada … and went on a seven-day backpacking trip.”","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Review: BlueLounge's Kickflip is a low-cost way to make typing on Apple's MacBook Pro even better","slug":"review-bluelounges-kickflip-is-a-low-cost-way-to-make-typing-on-apples-macbook-pro-even-better","date":"2014-08-29T16:45:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"29/08/2014/review-bluelounges-kickflip-is-a-low-cost-way-to-make-typing-on-apples-macbook-pro-even-better/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/29/08/2014/review-bluelounges-kickflip-is-a-low-cost-way-to-make-typing-on-apples-macbook-pro-even-better/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Saturday, August 30, 2014, 09:45 am PT (12:45 pm ET)Review By Sam OliverFor all of the time and effort Jony Ive &amp; Co. have spent crafting their oft-imitated MacBook Pro designs, there is one problem that they’ve yet to overcome: laptop ergonomics are, by their nature, terrible. AppleInsider took a look at the latest accessory attempting to right this wrong, BlueLounge’s new Kickflip stand. “The design of laptops violates a basic ergonomic requirement for a computer, namely that the keyboard and screen are separated,” according to Cornell University’s ergonomics reference site. The idea is that neither the keyboard nor the screen should be in a position that causes the user to deviate from their ideal posture, with neck straight and wrists at a neutral position. With a laptop, this kind of optimization is impossible sans a phalanx of external accessories. Desk-bound laptop users have long employed docking stations, stands, external monitors, and wireless keyboards and mice to give their laptop the same ergonomic benefits as a properly-configured desktop machine. Laptop users should optimize their environment for typing, rather than reading, if forced to choose. These accoutrements don’t travel well, though. Using a laptop by itself on a coffee shop table or a hotel desk angles the users’ arms and forces wrists to a non-neutral position, an ergonomic no-no for typing. So what are mobile laptop users to do? Faced with the choice of optimizing for neck posture or wrist posture, Cornell recommends that users lean toward the latter — and that’s where BlueLounge’s Kickflip can help. We spent two weeks with the $19.95, 15-inch Kickflip model, using our 2011 MacBook Pro alone on a desk without the usual array of ergonomic accessories. BlueLounge also offers a smaller, $17.95 model that fits the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air. Design &amp; Installation The Kickflip is an extremely simple accessory, made of two pieces of plastic — attached at a hinge — and a strip of adhesive. The plastic feels sturdy, with a texture somewhere between soft-touch and a traditional hard finish. The BlueLounge logo is embossed into the “foot” portion of the Kickflip, and peeks out from underneath the laptop when extended. Running along the widest part of the Kickflip is a strip of what the company calls “German engineered gel adhesive.” This is the only thing that binds the Kickflip to the laptop, and we found it to be plenty strong while maintaining its adhesiveness after repeated repositioning. Speaking of repositioning, we would’ve welcomed the inclusion of some kind of guide to help us put the Kickflip on straight. The installation process — remove cover strip from adhesive, press onto laptop — isn’t exactly difficult, but it is somewhat bothersome. In Use Energizer AA battery for scale. No bananas were available. Using the Kickflip is even easier than installing it: flip the foot down when you’re sitting at a table, flip it back up when you leave. We found the additional angle on the keyboard to be a pleasant addition that made typing much easier, as it allowed our wrists to stay at a nearly-neutral angle. As a bonus, the incline also helped lessen the sting of the sharp metal edges on the MacBook Pro’s wrist rests. The Kickflip also adds a nearly-imperceptible amount of lift when closed, just enough to raise the MacBook’s rear feet off of the surface. That brings up our biggest gripe with the Kickflip: the lack of grip. We like the Kickflip if for no other reason than that it helps alleviate the MacBook Pro’s sharp edges. The Kickflip’s foot makes contact with the table surface along its edge. The tiny strip of hard plastic doesn’t offer much purchase, and we occasionally found ourselves accidentally pushing the laptop away when typing or using the trackpad. On the natural wood desk we use in our home office, the problem is almost nonexistent. The slick melamine surface of the shared tables in our coworking space, however, exacerbated the issue and forced us to use a small piece of non-slip mat underneath — the kind usually used in the cabinets of boat galleys. We also don’t like the way the foot “flops” out away from the laptop when closed, which occasionally cause it to snag when sliding it out of our bag. Even at the cost of complexity and additional dollars, we would’ve preferred that the foot be sprung to keep it more secure when stowed. The Kickflip’s foot “flops” out slightly when not in use, sometimes causing it to snag on bags. ConclusionSubjectively, we feel noticeably less wrist fatigue when using the Kickflip than when we keep the laptop directly on our desk. Of course, the same effect could be had simply by propping up the back of our laptop on a book, but that’s not the most stable nor portable arrangement. On balance, the Kickflip is a useful accessory that falls down just slightly thanks to a couple of questionable design decisions. The ergonomic benefits outweigh our minor grumbles, though, and we feel comfortable recommending the Kickflip without reservation for anyone who is often forced to use their laptop by itself on a desk.

The New York Stock Exchange, credit Carlos Delgado via Wikipedia. Shares of AAPL stock closed the day on Friday at $102.50, which is a new record. Intraday trading also reached $102.90. The company’s stock trended upward since Wednesday as anticipation builds for the its event now less than a week and a half away. Though the date had already leaked, Apple made it official on Thursday, sending out invitations to members of the press for a Sept. 9 event in Cupertino, Calif. The company is widely expected to use the event to formally unveil its next-generation “iPhone 6,” as well as an all-new wearable “iWatch.” Wall Street is particularly excited about the next iPhone, as Apple’s hot selling handsets account for the lion’s share of the company’s profits. Less certain is how a so-called “iWatch” might affect the company’s bottom line, but investors may have to wait to find out: Though Apple’s wearable device is expected to be revealed Sept. 9, the latest rumors suggest the device may not be ready to launch until early 2015.

The chip does not sport a manufacturer’s name or mark. Instead, it bears only identification code “NSD425” alongside miscellaneous other numbers, likely batch identifiers, according to the photos published by blogger Sonny Dickson. No such chip can be found among NXP’s offerings, but Apple often works with silicon vendors to produce bespoke components. The Dutch firm was named late Thursday by the Financial Times as the supplier of Apple’s NFC hardware. Also present is a chip that seems to be Apple’s “A8” processor. The package is noticeably smaller than its predecessor, the A7, allowing for a more tightly-packed logic board. Other identifiable chips on the board are two Avago RF modules — Avago is a longtime supplier of such chips for Apple — and a Toshiba NAND module. Separately, Feld &amp; Volk posted a new video on Friday with a purported “iPhone 6” assembled from parts the company obtained. The video shows their attempts to turn on the device, being greeted with the “Connect to iTunes” screen and unable to boot further. The screen shows Apple’s current iTunes for OS X Mavericks logo, rather than the new red logo found in OS X Yosemite. If what the video shows is indeed legitimate, it would suggest that the hardware has an older version of iOS 8 installed, as the latest beta updated the “Connect to iTunes” screen to display the OS X Yosemite logo for the iTunes desktop suite.

AppleInsider was first to discover an Apple patent filing describing a watch design with flexible display. Citing “sources in position to know,” the well-connected John Paczkowski of Re/code reported on Friday that Apple’s anticipated wearable device isn’t shipping “any time soon.” Though he said it’s “not clear” when Apple plans to ship the device, he said that onlookers should “think early 2015.” ## What to expect:‘iWatch’ rumors Fall 2014 launch Health &amp; fitness focus Biometric sensors iPhone connectivity Two sizes for men &amp; women ➤ Learn more Such a move wouldn’t be unprecedented, as Apple had delays between the announcement and eventual launch of both the iPhone and iPad. However, both of those devices were introduced in January, just after the lucrative holiday shopping season. Apple had a five-month lead time between the announcement of the first iPhone and its launch in June of 2007. The wait time between the unveiling and launch of the first iPad, which runs a scaled-up version of the iPhone operating system, was considerably shorter, at just over two months. If the “iWatch” debuts on Sept. 9 and follows the iPhone’s release schedule, it wouldn’t hit the market until February of 2015. But if the company were to somehow reach production as quickly as the iPad did, which Paczkowski’s sources apparently do not believe will be the case, Apple could have the first units on sale in November. The latest rumor comes on the heels of claims from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who suggested earlier this month that Apple may be facing internal delays for the unannounced product. Problems in bringing the device to market are said to be related to components, system design, manufacturing, and integration between hardware and software. Specifically, Kuo has claimed that Apple faces sapphire cover production bottlenecks, which he said may force the company to use glass screen covers for about half of the “iWatch” units it ships. He also believes the device will sport a curved AMOLED display built by LG Display that presents difficulties in manufacturing. “iWatch” concept by Martin Hajek. Apple send out invitations to members of the media on Thursday for a Sept. 9 event, where the company is widely expected to unveil both the “iWatch” and a next-generation “iPhone 6.” While the next iPhone is expected to come in two screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches, and numerous parts for the anticipated handset have leaked online, much less is known about the “iWatch.” To date, there haven’t been any parts leaked online suggesting what Apple’s wearable project might look like. That would imply that manufacturing of the device has not yet begun. Rumors about the device’s design, meanwhile, have been inconsistent on everything from shape to screen size. Reports have claimed it will feature a touchscreen of some type, whether OLED or otherwise, and that the “iWatch” will run a modified version of the iOS platform that powers the iPhone and iPad. It’s expected to connect to and act as an accessory for the iPhone, and also to focus on tracking and measuring health and fitness data. To that end, it’s been speculated that the “iWatch” will be a key component of the new Health application built into the forthcoming iOS 8 update for iPhone.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Samsung asks New Yorkers to compare Apple's iPad Air to Galaxy Tab S in new ad","slug":"samsung-asks-new-yorkers-to-compare-apples-ipad-air-to-galaxy-tab-s-in-new-ad","date":"2014-08-28T15:33:23.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"28/08/2014/samsung-asks-new-yorkers-to-compare-apples-ipad-air-to-galaxy-tab-s-in-new-ad/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/28/08/2014/samsung-asks-new-yorkers-to-compare-apples-ipad-air-to-galaxy-tab-s-in-new-ad/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Friday, August 29, 2014, 08:33 am PT (11:33 am ET) By Sam OliverIn a new spot posted to its YouTube account on Friday, Samsung took to the streets of New York City and asked consumers to compare the Galaxy Tab S to the iPad Air, with the results predictably skewed in favor of the Samsung tablet. Hosted by a wild-haired young man named Deval, the one minute and twenty-two second commercial invites people who are out-and-about to compare the slates primarily on physical features, like thinness and weight. “It’s actually really light,” says one man, and “this one’s thinner,” says another, referring to the Galaxy Tab S.

The pictured components look almost identical to previous leaks and appear to be for a 4.7-inch device. They first appeared on Chinese web forum Wei Feng, where the original poster made no claims as to their provenance. The shell itself features a series of seemingly plastic “ribbons” that surround its upper and lower extremes, where glass would normally be found on an iPhone 5 or 5s. The strips are closer in color to the metal than they have been in previous leaks, suggesting that they may remain in the final version. It is unclear whether the ribbons are meant to act as radio-transparent covers for the handset’s antenna system, or if they act as insulators of some kind. At least one previous rumor suggested that the design was not final, and the ribbons denoted areas that would be replaced with glass in the final model.

Citing people familiar with Apple’s plans, the Financial Times reports the company has been working with NXP on contactless mobile payment system based on near-field communication technology, possibly tied to users’ iTunes accounts. According to hardware analysis firm Chipworks, NXP already has a significant presence in Apple’s iOS device lineup as the Dutch chipmaker supplies the iPhone 5s’ M7 motion coprocessor. ## What to expect:‘iPhone 6’ rumors Larger screen, thinner design Two new sizes: 4.7” &amp; 5.5” Faster next-gen ‘A8’ CPU Fall 2014 launch *➤ Learn moreWith the rumored system in place, iPhone owners would be able to store credit card and other payment information locally and simply tap the handset against compatible point of sale terminals. As credit card theft still a major problem around the world, companies like Visa and Mastercard are moving toward more secure solutions, specifically chip-and-PIN POS systems — which happen to include support for certain NFC-based standards — that should roll out across their respective networks by October 2015, the report says.Apple holds a number of patents relating to NFC payments solutions and the company has long been rumored to be looking to introduce such capability in its iOS device lineup. On Thursday, a pair of reports claimed the iPhone 6 would be the first Apple device to sport an NFC chip, to be leveraged for digital wallet purposes.It remains unclear if Apple’s mobile payments plans will rely solely on NFC, though such a scenario seems unlikely given that its massive installed iOS device user base would be left out unless they upgrade to new hardware. Successfully introducing a new form of payment means wide adoption consumer adoption. One possible stopgap could be a hybrid setup using either on-board NFC or, if the user does not own a new iPhone, a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless data.Along with digital wallet capabilities, today’s report claims NXP’s chip may also be used to bolster the next-generation iPhone’s compatibility with the so-called “internet of things,” a catchall phrase describing connected devices like health trackers to app-powered home appliances. The forthcoming iOS 8 mobile operating system bound for Apple’s “iPhone 6” does include a powerful framework for smart home products called HomeKit, which could theoretically support NFC-equipped products.Apple is expected to announce its new iPhone lineup at a special event on Sept. 9, which according to multiple reports will also include the unveiling of an “iWatch” wearable device.

I’ve been working on a new joke — about NFC and a new secure enclave where you can store your credit cards, so you can pay for things at brick and mortar retail stores just by taking out your iPhone, but only if it’s one of the new iPhones — but no one seems to get my sense of humor. The post comes just hours after Wired issued a report framing NFC as “one of the hallmark features“ of Apple’s next iPhone. Supposedly backing up these rumors are purported “iPhone 6” schematics and component “leaks” that suggest support for an NFC-compliant chip. ## What to expect:‘iPhone 6’ rumors Larger screen, thinner design Two new sizes: 4.7” &amp; 5.5” Faster next-gen ‘A8’ CPU Fall 2014 launch *➤ Learn moreNFC has for years been rumored for inclusion in Apple’s iPhone, but the technology has yet to show up in a production model. With the iPhone 5, for example, industry watchers jumped on a batch of photos revealing an unknown component attached to the phone’s logic board, claiming it was clear evidence of NFC support. The part turned out to be a high-resolution ear speaker.Apple is experimenting with NFC, as can be seen in a multitude of patents, but as SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said in a 2012 interview, the company is more concerned about user experience than shoehorning in the latest tech just because it can. At the time, Schiller said Passbook covered the bases for consumers. It should be noted, however, that the payments landscape is quickly changing.As for the secure enclave, Apple currently employs a similar component in the iPhone 5s to store data referenced by the Touch ID fingerprint recognition system. According to a security white paper published in February, the enclave is built into Apple’s A7 SoC and comes complete with its own secure boot sequence and software update mechanism. Apple says the component is responsible for “all cryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and maintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel has been compromised.”For clarification, Gruber’s comments about a “new joke” and “sense of humor” are allusions to a report from Re/code’s John Paczkowski, who earlier Thursday cited sources as saying Apple would unveil its long-awaited “iWatch” wearable at its upcoming Sept. 9 special event.In August, Gruber made a casual remark about Apple’s “wrist wearable thing,” saying it would launch in September, only to later claim the comment was made in jest.

Ahead of Apple’s expected iOS 8 launch in September, the company has restricted developers from selling or otherwise distributing sensitive data collected by the HealthKit application programming interface, which is set to debut as part of the new mobile operating system. The terms, buried in the latest iOS 8 beta’s licensing agreement, were highlighted by the Financial Timeson Thursday. According to text pulled from the license, developers may “not sell an end-user’s health information collected through the HealthKit API to advertising platforms, data brokers or information resellers,” and are barred from using gathered data “for any purpose other than providing health and/or fitness services.” In addition to the imposed data sharing restrictions, apps using the HealthKit API must provide privacy policies to end users. Apple’s HealthKit is a framework made available to third-party hardware and software makers that aggregates and stores harvested health data. Users have access to the metrics via iOS 8’s built-in Health app, which serves as a centralized hub for viewing and sharing tracked information associated with user activity, sleep patterns and more. Along with third-party tools, the Health app is capable of gathering data from Apple hardware like the M7 motion coprocessor found in the latest iPhone 5s. Further, the company is expected to announce a wrist-worn “iWatch” device thought to carry a host of sensors for health related monitoring. For advertisers, the repository would be a gold mine, providing invaluable insight into how to better target ads to consumers. Apple, however, is already looking ahead to skirt possible privacy issues. Senior executives have met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss regulatory issues and the company is reportedly in talks with major medical records systems firms, insurers and healthcare providers eager to integrate with HealthKit. Apple is expected to launch HealthKit as part of iOS 8 on Sept. 9, when the company will be holding a special event widely thought to feature the next-generation iPhone lineup.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple again rumored to unveil 'iWatch' alongside next-gen iPhones on Sept. 9","slug":"apple-again-rumored-to-unveil-iwatch-alongside-next-gen-iphones-on-sept-9","date":"2014-08-27T22:04:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"27/08/2014/apple-again-rumored-to-unveil-iwatch-alongside-next-gen-iphones-on-sept-9/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/27/08/2014/apple-again-rumored-to-unveil-iwatch-alongside-next-gen-iphones-on-sept-9/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 28, 2014, 03:04 pm PT (06:04 pm ET) By AppleInsider Staff Seemingly corroborating recent claims that Apple will launch its long-awaited “iWatch” wearable at an upcoming iPhone special event, Bloomberg on Thursday reported that the company decided to pair the two hardware announcements in order to “manage expectations” of the hotly anticipated wearable. ## What to expect:‘iWatch’ rumors Fall 2014 launch Health &amp; fitness focus Biometric sensors iPhone connectivity Two sizes for men &amp; women ➤ Learn moreCiting sources with information on the matter, Bloomberg says Apple will unveil a so-called “iWatch” wearable device alongside the next-generation iPhone lineup at a special event on Sept. 9.

Citing unnamed “sources familiar with the matter,” Wired reported on Thursday that an NFC chip capable of mobile payments will be “one of the hallmark features” of Apple’s next-generation iPhone, which is expected to debut on Sept. 9. Details on how the system might work were not relayed, though it’s speculated that Apple would leverage its Touch ID fingerprint sensing technology, along with a massive collection of active iTunes accounts, to make its e-wallet service stand out. ## What to expect:‘iPhone 6’ rumors Larger screen, thinner design Two new sizes: 4.7” &amp; 5.5” Faster next-gen ‘A8’ CPU Fall 2014 launch *➤ Learn more The rumor also comes as AppleInsider discovered a new patent application earlier Thursday that described using an NFC chip to allow inductive, cordless charging on mobile devices, like an iPhone or even a mythical “iWatch.” The filing details how a device could make use of an NFC antennae to double as an inductor for charging, negating the need to duplicate any hardware. Thursday’s report isn’t the first to suggest that Apple might adopt NFC technology in its next iPhone. Earlier this month, a leaked schematic claimed to be from the “iPhone 6” suggested that an NFC chip could be included inside the device. Similar conclusions were drawn from a leaked part that surfaced in July. Apple has also filed for patents that describe mobile payment systems utilizing NFC RFID technology. But to date, the company has relied on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for short-range wireless functions, most notably with the company’s proprietary combination of the two, dubbed iBeacon. Rumors of NFC functionality in a future iPhone have persisted for years, and seem to appear leading up to just about every new handset launch. And though there have been a multitude of NFC-capable smartphones on the market for years, has never been an Apple product with NFC functionality. One rumor that surfaced this summer claimed that Apple was accelerating work on a mobile payments system that could be ready by this fall, launching as part of the “iPhone 6.” That report claimed that Apple was in talks with partner companies, including Visa, in an effort to debut its own e-wallet platform. But Apple’s reluctance to embrace NFC thus far has led some to speculate that the company could create a mobile payments system that relies on the established Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combination of iBeacon, which would be capable on existing iPhone models, and presumably as well on the anticipated “iPhone 6.” One Apple patent filing even describes in great detail a system using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to offer mobile payments.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple exploring double-duty NFC, inductive charging coil for smartwatches, mobile phones","slug":"apple-exploring-double-duty-nfc-inductive-charging-coil-for-smartwatches-mobile-phones","date":"2014-08-27T13:45:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"27/08/2014/apple-exploring-double-duty-nfc-inductive-charging-coil-for-smartwatches-mobile-phones/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/27/08/2014/apple-exploring-double-duty-nfc-inductive-charging-coil-for-smartwatches-mobile-phones/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 28, 2014, 06:45 am PT (09:45 am ET) By AppleInsider StaffOn the heels of a report suggesting that Apple’s long-anticipated “iWatch” could be unveiled within the next two weeks, a new patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office shows that the company has continued to contemplate wireless charging solutions for just such a device. A wristwatch-like device as illustrated in Apple’s patent application The patent&amp;OS=An/apple+and+pd/8/28/2014&amp;RS=(AN/apple+AND+PD/20140828)), entitled “wirelessly charged electronic device with shared inductor circuitry,” describes a method in which inductive charging mechanisms can be made smaller in order to fit inside more diminutive wearables. Apple specifically calls out “wrist-watch devices, pendant devices, or other wearable…devices” alongside traditional portables like mobile phones. Using a cable to charge these devices can be “unwieldy,” Apple argues, but felt compelled to invent the new methods because current wireless charging circuitry may be too bulky. Interestingly, the patent appears to focus on ways in which Apple could make use of inductors already present in devices, rather than duplicating hardware. The charging circuit could make use of the magnetic coils of a speaker, for instance, or NFC antennae. “Switching circuitry in the wireless charging circuitry can selectively couple the capacitor to the inductor when wireless charging signals are being received and converted into power in the electronic device and can selectively isolate the inductor from the capacitor when it is desired to use the inductor as part of a speaker, vibrator, or near field communications circuit,” the application reads. The application was filed in February 2013 and Apple credits Jeffrey J. Terlizzi with the invention of U.S. Patent Application No. 13/776,436. Terlizzi’s name is on a number of Apple patents, including the Lightning connector. Apple has been investigating wireless charging technology for years, holding a bevy of patents on the subject covering both inductive and magnetic resonance charging. Most recently, the company won a patent for a charging dock that could switch between data synchronization, diagnostics, or charging based on the orientation of the device on the dock.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple wins patent for Steve Jobs-designed Fifth Ave glass cube","slug":"apple-wins-patent-for-steve-jobs-designed-fifth-ave-glass-cube","date":"2014-08-27T12:11:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"27/08/2014/apple-wins-patent-for-steve-jobs-designed-fifth-ave-glass-cube/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/27/08/2014/apple-wins-patent-for-steve-jobs-designed-fifth-ave-glass-cube/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 28, 2014, 05:11 am PT (08:11 am ET) By Katie MarsalThe iconic Fifth Avenue Apple Store glass cube, which was designed in part by legendary company co-founder Steve Jobs, is now a patented ornamental building design sanctioned by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patent was officially granted this week, and represents the latest design of the 32-foot cube, which uses fewer panes of glass to achieve a cleaner aesthetic. The simpler look came as a result of a redesign that was completed in late 2011. Previously, the cube used 90 panes of glass, but Apple sunk an estimated $6.7 million into the 15-pane redesign at its flagship New York City store. The cube was personally designed by Jobs and is one of the most photographed landmarks in the city. The former CEO even paid for the project himself, and was the owner of the structure. Jobs is actually credited as one of seven inventors of the structure, and is joined by former retail chief Ron Johnson. The other inventors are Karl Backus, Peter Bohlin, Robert Bridger, Benjamin L. Fay, and James O’Callaghan. The term of the newly awarded building patent is 14 years. Apple originally filed for the patent in October of 2012. The all-glass design has even inspired other projects from Apple, including its megastore in Shanghai that opened in 2010. Like the Fifth Avenue store, its entrance is a staircase enclosed in glass, though the one in China is a cylinder.

Set in 1960, the game’s protagonist Jack crash lands his plane near a gateway to Rapture, an underwater Utopia created by businessman Andrew Ryan. After discovering a powerful plasmid dubbed ADAM, the city fell into turmoil, creating roving bands of genetically modified inhabitants locked in a struggle for power. Blending frenetic FPS gameplay with role-playing elements, BioShock is driven by an intriguing storyline layered with philosophical undertones, the most influential being Ayn Rand’s Objectivism.

LG’s announcement comes as somewhat of a surprise given the company just this weekend teased the G Watch R in a YouTube video touting the device’s circular display and supposed reveal at this year’s IFA, which is set to kick off on Sept. 5. According to Engadget, the G Watch R boasts a full 360-degree 1.3-inch, 320-by-320-pixel Plastic OLED (P-OLED) display and case styling more in line with classic wristwatches than modern smartwatch products like Pebble or Samsung’s Galaxy Gear lineup. The wearable is meant to complement LG’s existing offerings, including the current square-screened G Watch that was first announced in March. Interestingly, the upcoming version takes cues from Motorola’s Moto 360 that was announced alongside the original G Watch as one of the first devices to run Google’s Android Wear operating system. LG is touting the G Watch R’s unique circular form factor as a main selling point, poking fun at the Moto 360’s “flat tire” design in this past weekend’s video. The Moto 360’s display is not a complete circle, having a bottom slice cut out to house an ambient light sensor and screen control circuitry. Aside from the format change, however, the G Watch R appears to be a repackaged version of the original G Watch model. Both run a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset with 512MB of RAM, include 4GB of flash storage and come with interchangeable straps. The new version does feature a heart rate monitor built into the case back, as well as a physical power button that doubles as the watch’s crown, much like the Moto 360. LG’s G Watch R is expected to see limited release in the fourth quarter, meaning it will face stiff competition from the likes of Motorola, Samsung and possibly Apple. Samsung on Wednesday also announced a new smartwatch called the Gear S, which features a curved two-inch Super AMOLED display, heart rate sensor, turn-by-turn navigation via Nokia’s HERE and two days of battery life. One of the more novel capabilities is 3G cellular connectivity, which supports both voice calling and data transfer when phone tethering is not available. A report earlier today claimed Apple is planning to announce its own highly anticipated entry into the smartwatch segment at a special event on Sept. 9, which is also expected to feature the next-generation iPhone lineup.

According to the order relating to the second Apple v. Samsung court trial in California, Apple did not adequately demonstrate it was irreparably harmed and tie any alleged harm to Samsung’s infringement of three granted patents. From Judge Koh’s order: Apple has not established that it suffered significant harm in the form of either lost sales or reputational injury. Moreover, Apple has not shown that it suffered any of these alleged harms because Samsung infringed Apple’s patents. The Federal Circuit has cautioned that the plaintiff must demonstrate a causal nexus between its supposed harm (including reputational harm) and the specific infringement at issue. Apple has not demonstrated that the patented inventions drive consumer demand for the infringing products The ruling comes as post-trial proceedings continue after a jury awarded Apple $119.6 million in damages in May. Apple was also found guilty of infringing upon a single Samsung patent, for which the jury assigned a $158,000 award. Wednesday’s decision was based both on trial testimony and subsequent hearings from Apple and Samsung. In its second major California court action against the Korean company, Apple asserted a total of five patents, three of which were found actionable in the case. In a summary judgment leading up to the trial, Judge Koh found Samsung in infringement of Apple’s ‘172 patent for predictive text input. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office later rejected key claims of the asserted IP, leaving damages and motions based on the patent in the lurch. Today’s denial is yet another setback for Apple in its numerous bids to ban Samsung products in the U.S. and abroad. The company recently withdrew a cross-appeal of Judge Koh’s final judgment in the first Apple v. Samsung case, dropping a sought injunction against 23 patent-infringing devices. That particular demand was denied twice before Apple successfully argued an appeal of Judge Koh’s original ruling, though the motion was ultimately put to bed. More recently, Judge Koh released Apple’s $26 million bond the company put up in association with a proposed Galaxy Tab 10.1 sales ban after both Apple and Samsung withdrew motions regarding the enforcement of an injunction.

He still expects that the company will hold an October event, presumably to introduce its fall lineup of iPads. “With its best product pipeline in 25 years, Apple should have more than enough hardware to fill two events,” he said. Previously, Apple pundit John Gruber had stirred up hope of a September event with an offhand comment he had made earlier this month, suggesting that a “wearable thing” from the company could debut before the much-hyped Motorola Moto 360 smart watch. But Gruber later clarified that his comments were intended as a “joke” and were not based on any inside information. Paczkowski was also the first to report that Apple is planning a Sept. 9 event, where the company is expected to introduce its new iPhone lineup in two screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches. That date is still unconfirmed, however, as Apple typically waits until about one week before an event before sending invitations to members of the press. AppleInsider was first to discover an Apple patent filing describing a watch design with flexible display. Word of the September unveiling comes after a series of reports suggested that the wrist-worn device is facing production issues and could be delayed. Well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has said that Apple may be forced to delay the launch of the product until 2015. Of course, a Sept. 9 unveiling could go either way: Apple could unveil the product but launch at a much later date — as it did in 2013 when the Mac Pro launched more than six months after it was teased at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Or the company could be planning a September unveiling with plans to get the new device onto users’ wrists in time for the holiday 2014 shopping season. “iWatch” concept by Martin Hajek. Apple’s wrist-worn device is expected to focus on health and fitness tracking, measuring and analyzing a user’s activity and heart rate and other bio-feedback. That data could be utilized by the new Health app found in iOS 8. As for the “iWatch” hardware itself, little is known and thus far no parts have leaked. Some rumors have suggested Apple will utilize a flexible OLED display for a more form-fitting design, while some suspect the company could use sapphire to protect the screen from scratches. Still other reports have claimed that Apple will offer the “iWatch” in two sizes, intended for both men and women. Kuo has said he believes Apple will utilize AMOLED touchscreens sized at 1.3 and 1.5 inches, while other reports have claimed even larger displays of 2.5 inches.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple adds AT&T Next as online payment option for iPhone buyers","slug":"apple-adds-att-next-as-online-payment-option-for-iphone-buyers","date":"2014-08-26T16:49:57.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"26/08/2014/apple-adds-att-next-as-online-payment-option-for-iphone-buyers/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/26/08/2014/apple-adds-att-next-as-online-payment-option-for-iphone-buyers/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Wednesday, August 27, 2014, 09:49 am PT (12:49 pm ET) By AppleInsider StaffApple on Thursday quietly added a new payment option to its online storefront, giving AT&amp;T subscribers who are in the market for a new iPhone the ability to make their purchase using installments through the carrier’s AT&amp;T Next program. The initiative will allow consumers to spread the unsubsidized cost of the iPhone out over either 12 or 18 months, without the necessity of signing a fixed service contract. They are then eligible to upgrade to a new device at the end of the term. Consumers can cancel their subscription at any time, but they will be on the hook for the balance of the handset’s cost. Though there is no required down payment, Apple says they will collect sales tax at the time of purchase. Those living in states that do not levy a sales tax could find themselves going through the purchase process without paying anything. AT&amp;T announced Next last July, on the heels of T-Mobile’s introduction of the similar Jump program. “With AT&amp;T Next, customers can get the newest smartphone or tablet every year with no down payment,” AT&amp;T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega said at the time. “That’s hard to beat, and it’s an incredible value for customers who want the latest and greatest every year.”","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple will re-bid on nixed $1 billion LA Unified School District iPad contract","slug":"apple-will-re-bid-on-nixed-1-billion-la-unified-school-district-ipad-contract","date":"2014-08-26T15:34:12.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"26/08/2014/apple-will-re-bid-on-nixed-1-billion-la-unified-school-district-ipad-contract/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/26/08/2014/apple-will-re-bid-on-nixed-1-billion-la-unified-school-district-ipad-contract/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Wednesday, August 27, 2014, 08:34 am PT (11:34 am ET) By Neil HughesThough Apple’s contract with the Los Angeles Unified School District to put iPads in the hands of every student was canceled this week, the company still has a shot to win out in the end, bidding once again on the troubled $1 billion project. Both Apple and Pearson had their contracts severed by Los Angeles officials this week, but they will be supplying new bids as the nation’s second-largest district looks to regroup, according toThe Wall Street Journal. Still, the canceled contract essentially sets Apple back at square one, more than a year after the company had publicly touted the deal as a coup for the iPad in education. The original plan called for a $1 billion rollout of iPads sporting digital textbooks from Pearson to all public school students in the Los Angeles area. But the project quickly ran grossly over budget, and more recently the deal was scrutinized as accusations arose that top employees at the district had improperly close ties with Apple. Specifically, Superintendent John Deasy and Deputy Superintendent Jaime Aquino were found to have had regular contact with executives at both Apple and Pearson well before they won the contract, which gave some the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. Deasy insists that the bidding process was conducted properly, but agreed to cancel the contract to “take advantage of an ever-changing marketplace” and also give “time to take into account concerns raised” about the project. As of now, there’s no timeframe as to how the future re-bidding process will work. So far, Los Angeles had spent about $61 million on tablets and laptops for about 40 schools, or 4 percent of the district. Though Apple will apparently remain a part of the bidding process, the company has remained silent on the nixing of the contract, and has not responded to accusations that it worked improperly close with the district superintendent in order to secure the deal. While Los Angeles got cold feet, other schools around the country have been embracing Apple’s iPad, including an announcement this week from Minnesota’s St. Paul School District, which plans to roll out 40,000 iPads to students in 37 schools around the city. Rather than purchasing the tablets, the school district plans to lease them from Apple. Apple revealed in its last quarterly earnings call that more than 13 million iPads have been sold for education globally. The company also said it currently sells 2 and a half iPads for every Mac sold to kindergarten through 12th grade institutions.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"LaCie unveils 48TB Thunderbolt 2 drive, Dropbox upgrades Pro plans to 1TB","slug":"lacie-unveils-48tb-thunderbolt-2-drive-dropbox-upgrades-pro-plans-to-1tb","date":"2014-08-26T13:52:58.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"26/08/2014/lacie-unveils-48tb-thunderbolt-2-drive-dropbox-upgrades-pro-plans-to-1tb/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/26/08/2014/lacie-unveils-48tb-thunderbolt-2-drive-dropbox-upgrades-pro-plans-to-1tb/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Wednesday, August 27, 2014, 06:52 am PT (09:52 am ET) By Sam OliverApple users gained two additional high-capacity storage options on Wednesday, as external drive maker LaCie showed off its new rack-mount Thunderbolt 2 drive in a 48 terabyte configuration and cloud storage firm Dropbox announced that its $9.99-per-month Pro plan will now include 1 terabyte of space.

In addition, Apple will spend another $5.6 billion on other obligations such as tooling, capital assets, advertising, and research and development, representing a huge 300 percent year over year increase. While R&amp;D spiked $425 million last quarter to reach a record $1.6 billion, Daryanani also took note of the “material spike” in commitments for tooling. With Apple spending more money than ever on tooling ahead of this fall’s anticipated product launches, Daryanani speculates that the company is spending ahead of the debut of not only its next-generation iPhone, but also a new product category that he believes could be the long-rumored “iWatch.” Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone at a media event on Sept. 9, while a separate event to showcase the company’s first wearable device is rumored to take place in October. While Apple’s spending and commitments continue to grow, so does the company’s cash: As of the end of the June quarter, Apple had $164.5 billion, with $137.7 billion of it held overseas and the remaining $28.6 billion in the U.S. Apple’s overall cash balance was up $17.9 billion year over year, a 12 percent increase. Apple is also guiding for its fiscal 2014 capital expenditures to reach a total of $11 billion, with $4.8 billion left to be spent. Apple expects to spend $500 million to build 20 new retail stores and remodel 15 more, with the remaining $10.5 billion to product tooling, manufacturing, process equipment and other items. RBC Capital Markets has maintained its $110 price target for shares of AAPL, which it has held since late July. With $164 billion in cash amounting to a whopping $22 per share, and a “busy fall” expected, Daryanani continues to believe that shares of Apple are undervalued at their current levels.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Rumor: TSMC, Apple working on 16nm FinFET process for 'A9' chips","slug":"rumor-tsmc-apple-working-on-16nm-finfet-process-for-a9-chips","date":"2014-08-24T16:18:34.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"24/08/2014/rumor-tsmc-apple-working-on-16nm-finfet-process-for-a9-chips/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/24/08/2014/rumor-tsmc-apple-working-on-16nm-finfet-process-for-a9-chips/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Monday, August 25, 2014, 09:18 am PT (12:18 pm ET) By Sam OliverA Monday morning report from the Republic of China indicated that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is in the process of accelerating the rollout of its new 16-nanometer FinFET fabrication process in a possible bid to wrest control of Apple’s A9 manufacturing from rival chipmakers.Apple’s A7 SoC is manufactured by Samsung and powers the iPhone 5s, Retina iPad mini and iPad Air.Source: iFixit The report, from the Chinese-language Economic Daily News, directly contradicts earlier whispers that Samsung had won Apple’s orders for the A9.

It is unclear what wafer size the plant would use in production, though its current 16-nanometer test lines utilize 12-inch wafers. Apple and TSMC have long worked together to produce smaller parts — the Taiwanese company produces the silicon for the iPhone 5s’s Touch ID sensors, for instance — but the production of more important components, like Apple’s A-series chips, has been left to Samsung. Tensions between Apple and its South Korean competitor are believed to have given TSMC a boost, however, with the latter reportedly beginning shipments of chips destined for the so-called “iPhone 6” in early July. The world’s other major chip foundries, including Intel and former AMD subsidiary GlobalFoundries, are also thought to be chasing Apple’s business.

Morgan analyst Rod Hall wrote in a Monday morning note to investors which was provided to AppleInsider. “We believe that initial supply could be slowed somewhat if there is any truth to this but we doubt that iPhone unit volumes in the fall are likely to be impacted.” Apple suppliers were “scrambling to get enough screens ready” for the launch, Reutersreported last week. Two issues — one said to revolve around backlight technology, and another referred to only as involving a “key component” — were pegged as having a potentially serious impact on Apple’s plans. At the time, it was “unclear” whether the problems could “delay the launch or limited the number of phones initially available to customers,” the outlet said. As for the track record for Reuters, the news publication also claimed last year that Apple’s iPad mini with Retina display may not arrive until 2014 due to alleged supply constraints. Of course, that report ended up being erroneous, as the high-resolution iPad mini launched last year without issue. As has become customary in the lead-up to the release of a new Apple product, the “iPhone 6” has been the subject of numerous delay rumors. Most have revolved around the potential pushback of a 5.5-inch “phablet” variant, which is believed to remain on track but may not make an appearance at the company’s rumored Sept. 9 special media event.

But for the “iPhone 6,” Samsung has been reportedly brought back into the fold, he said in a note to investors on Monday, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider. Other DRAM suppliers for Apple’s next-generation iPhone are said to be Micron and Elpida. DRAM is the system memory included inside the A-series processors that power Apple’s iPhone and iPad, which has remained at 1 gigabyte for the A6 chip found in the iPhone 5, as well as the A7 processor that powers the iPhone 5s. Exactly how much DRAM will be included in the anticipated “A8” processor expected to power Apple’s “iPhone 6” remains unknown. Additional RAM would allow applications to run in the background longer, or for the Safari browser to keep open websites cached without a need to reload, but more system RAM also results in faster battery drain to keep the memory powered. According to Acuri, Apple is expected to take up so much of the overall market supply of DRAM this fall that general prices will actually increase sequentially between 3 and 5 percent in September. Though Samsung is a heated rival with Apple, the company is also a key supplier of parts for the company’s hot selling iPhone models. Most notably, all of Apple’s custom A-series chips to date have been built at Samsung’s silicon fabrication operations based out of Austin, Tex. Samsung was found to have supplied DRAM for at least some of the first batch of A6 chips that powered the iPhone 5 in 2012. But Apple was said at the time to have quickly dropped the South Korean company, as Apple filled the void with suppliers Toshiba, Elpida Memory, and SK Hynix. As for last year’s A7 processor, initial teardowns of both the iPhone 5s and iPad Air discovered that the onboard DRAM was supplied by Elpida.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Document claims to detail 'Phosphorus,' a mysterious chip for Apple's 'iPhone 6' [u]","slug":"document-claims-to-detail-phosphorus-a-mysterious-chip-for-apples-iphone-6-u","date":"2014-08-24T11:40:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"24/08/2014/document-claims-to-detail-phosphorus-a-mysterious-chip-for-apples-iphone-6-u/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/24/08/2014/document-claims-to-detail-phosphorus-a-mysterious-chip-for-apples-iphone-6-u/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Monday, August 25, 2014, 04:40 am PT (07:40 am ET) By Neil HughesApple’s so-called “iPhone 6” may include a new chip code-named “Phosphorus” for analyzing new data, such as barometric pressure of the surrounding environment of the company’s motion coprocessor, a new schematic suggests [updated]. Update: While the original leak suggested the schematic above showed off a new “M8” motion coprocessor, a pair of knowledgeable commenters at MacRumors believe that the new mystery chip may actually be a barometric pressure sensor. The part is said to be similar to the Bosch BMP280. Commenter “leecbaker” suggested that the addition of a barometric pressure sensor to the “iPhone 6” could allow for enhanced GPS and indoor/outdoor navigation functions. Other uses would include forecasting weather, better measurement of altitude, and potentially helping to measure users’ breathing rates. The original story published earlier Monday remains in its entirety: Last year, Apple introduced the M7 coprocessor as part of the A7 system-on-a-chip inside the iPhone 5s, allowing battery-efficient motion tracking. This year’s “A8” chip may also feature an improved “M8” motion sensor, according to the latest alleged “iPhone 6” schematic, published on Monday through Geek Bar’s Weibo account and spotlighted by G for Games. While the document doesn’t offer any specifics on what upgrades the “M8” might accomplish, GeekBar speculates that the “Phosphorous” chip might help to collect and interpret new health-related data for the next-generation iPhone. Potential subjects suggested include heart rate, calories burned, cholesterol levels, blood sugar and more. Of course, all of that data can be read into the new Health app included in Apple’s next-generation iOS 8 mobile operating system, which will launch next month when Apple is widely expected to unveil its “iPhone 6.” If Apple does indeed have an “M8” in the works, it’s likely to be a part of a next-generation “A8” system-on-chip that will power the next iPhone. Some reports have claimed Apple’s new custom CPU will be a multi-core design clocked at up to 2 gigahertz. When the M7 was unveiled last year, observers speculated that Apple could be laying the groundwork for a new tool that could power the company’s so-called “iWatch,” which is expected to focus on collecting health and fitness data. As such, with an Apple wearable device expected to debut this fall, it’s also possible that an “M8” could be a hint of things to come in the “iWatch.” In its current incarnation, the M7 silently tracks user activity in the background. Compatible apps that tap into this data can track a user’s steps throughout the day, providing essentially the same functionality as popular pedometers like Fitbit.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Review: Apple's mid-2014 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display","slug":"review-apples-mid-2014-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-retina-display","date":"2014-08-23T14:15:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"23/08/2014/review-apples-mid-2014-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-retina-display/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/23/08/2014/review-apples-mid-2014-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-retina-display/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Sunday, August 24, 2014, 07:15 am PT (10:15 am ET)Review By Neil HughesWhile it’s not a particularly exciting update, Apple’s mid-2014 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display increases performance and offers more value, making it an enticing offer for those who may have been waiting to take the plunge on a thin-but-powerful high-resolution notebook. ConfigurationsFor our review, we opted to test the entry-level 13-inch model (model no. MGX72LL/A), featuring a 2.6 gigahertz processor, 8 gigabytes of RAM, Intel Iris integrated graphics, and 128 gigabytes of PCIe-based flash storage. This specific model represents arguably the greatest boost over the previous generation in Apple’s 2014 refresh, as the company upped the value by doubling the included RAM and packing in a slightly faster dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, all while maintaining the same $1,299 entry price. As part of Apple’s mid-2014 refresh of the 13-inch models, customers can pay another $200 and get a 2.6-gigahertz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with the same RAM and double the flash storage to 256 gigabytes. And a 2.8-gigahertz Core i5 with 512 gigabytes of flash memory starts at $1,799, with build-to-order options boosting processor and memory available. And as always, those looking for more horsepower than the 13-inch models provide should consider Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Pros, which were also recently updated to the latest Intel Haswell processors. The 15-inch notebooks start with 16 gigabytes of RAM, and users must upgrade to the larger form factor if they want to add a more powerful, dedicated Nvidia graphics card. For comparison, last year we also took a look at the entry-level $1,299 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. While the entry price had been reduced in 2013, Apple achieved that by offering just 4 gigabytes of RAM. Now in 2014, Apple is back where it started in 2012: 8 gigabytes of RAM, standard, but with a lower price. Apple’s new Macs all ship with with Mavericks, the company’s latest OS X operating system, as well as free copies of the iLife and iWork suites. Because Apple’s next-generation system, OS X Yosemite, remains in beta and does not ship with new Macs, we did not test it for this review. DesignThis year’s update features the same great unibody chassis as last year. That means it’s still slightly thinner than the 2012 model, coming in at 0.71-inch thick. The 2014 MacBook Pro update carries the same 3.46-pound weight and has the same high-resolution 13-inch Retina display, which outputs a native 2,560-by-1,600 pixel picture, with a resolution desnity of 227 pixels per inch. Ports on the outside also remain unchanged: The left side is home to a MagSafe 2 charging port, two Thunderbolt 2 inputs, a USB 3.0 port, 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, and two microphone holes. The right side has another USB 3.0 port, an HDMI out, and a full-size SD card slot. As with last year, Apple’s 13-inch model features the exact same ports found on the larger 15-inch model, so users who opt for the smaller form factor won’t miss out on any connectivity. Apple’s standard island-style backlit keys and industry-leading glass Trackpad also remain untouched. In short: The design is unchanged, and it’s still great. PerformanceThe mid-2014 13-inch MacBook Pro shows mild but noteworthy performance increases over last year’s model. The new processor is 0.2 gigahertz faster than the 2013 variant, using the same underlying architecture but offering identical battery life. We ran the latest entry-level model through a free 32-bit Geekbench test and found a single-core score of 2,865, besting last year’s 2,597. The multi-core test also showed improvement from 5,587 to this year’s new score of 5,975. In the Novabench test, we also found that the RAM performance was improved over last year, with a speed rated at 8,351 megabytes per second. Last year’s 4-gigabyte model that we tested had a slower RAM speed of 7,869 megabytes per second. Unsurprisingly, graphics performance was essentially the same across NovaBench, Unigine Heaven and Cinebench. The new MacBook Pro uses the same Intel Iris graphics as last year’s model, and the results were on par, and in many cases identical. Strangely, in the Unigine Heaven ultra stress-test, the software reported that the Intel Iris GPU was only providing 256 megabytes of virtual RAM. Considering the scores were largely identical with last year’s model, and our system’s preferences indicated that up to 1.5 gigabytes should be assigned dynamically by OS X Mavericks, we presume this was simply misreported by the application. And for a direct comparison to our tests from last year, we ran an older version of Cinebench, while also running the latest “R15” model. Scores for both are included in the chart seen above. Finally, NovaBench also showed that the flash drive’s write speeds on this year’s model were essentially identical to last year’s. In terms of battery life, Apple has rated the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display at up to nine hours of wireless web, up to 9 hours of iTunes movie playback, and up to 30 days standby time. In our tests, the MacBook Pro could easily get through a full workday as advertised. In a more extreme battery test, streaming YouTube videos at maximum brightness, the notebook made it over six hours before shutting off. ConclusionWith the positives unchanged, but better performance and value than last year’s excellent model, we have no problem recommending the mid-2014 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. Frankly, in a professional-grade machine, 8 gigabytes of RAM should be standard, and we’re happy that Apple met that mark without raising the price. If you already have a 2013 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, we see no reason to upgrade here. The clock speed on the new processor is indeed faster, but you won’t notice any more zip in day-to-day use without running benchmark tests to prove it. Owners of the very first 13-inch Retina model from 2012 should probably also wait. While the jump to Intel’s Haswell processors did boost performance and battery life and make this an enticing machine, an even more significant upgrade is likely coming next year with the company’s next-generation Broadwell chips. Since all of the 13-inch models from 2012 came with 8 gigabyte of RAM standard, the upgrade potential here is also lessened for most prospective buyers. But if you’re still running a legacy MacBook Pro, or you’re looking to slim down from a bulkier 15-inch model, or you want to transition to more power from a MacBook Air, or you are entirely new to the Mac family, this is as good of a time as any to pull the trigger and opt for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. Buyers in the market for this size and level of horsepower won’t be disappointed. The build is best in class, the performance is excellent, and the features and built-in software are exactly what you buy a Mac for. And with OS X Yosemite coming this fall as a free upgrade, your new Mac will gain even more functionality. Finally, if you’re ready to buy a MacBook Pro with Retina display but can’t decide between the 13- and 15-inch models, it’s simply a matter of power versus portability. The svelte form factor of the 13-inch model is ideal, and if you can get by without a dedicated graphics card, it’s an easy recommendation. If you need more pixel pushing power, or like to game occasionally, the 15-inch model — along with the optional Nvidia GPU upgrade — are probably a better bet. And in terms of what you’re paying for, while this year’s 13-inch model is a better value than last year, we still see the greatest dollar-to-performance ratio in the 15-inch MacBook Pro. But many professional users simply don’t need that much performance or screen size, and they don’t want the added bulk. Road warriors looking to maintain some portability will come away pleased — the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display hits a specific and ideal mix of size, performance and style. Score: 4 out of 5 Pros: 4 more gigabytes of RAM at the same entry price Faster CPU Same great design Cons: Still no discrete graphics option 15-inch still offers more performance for your buck, albeit with more bulk How to Get the Lowest Prices When Buying:Readers looking to purchase a mid-2014 MacBook Pro can take a look at our Price Guides to find the lowest possible prices. Through partnerships with some of Apple’s largest Authorized Resellers, AppleInsider is proud to offer the industry’s best pricing on MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and virtually all other Macs Apple offers. As of press time, several resellers are selling the $1,299 entry-level 13” MacBook Pro we tested (model no. MGX72LL/A) for $1,234.99, including B&amp;H Photo, which throws in your choice of either a free copy of Parallel’s Desktop for Mac or a 1-year subscription to LoJack for Laptops. You can also save another $69 by bundling a discounted 3-Year AppleCare Extended Protection Plan with this Mac from B&amp;H by selecting it from the “Protections Plans” drop down menu. The two together price out to $1,414.98 — a savings of $133 off Apple’s price for the bundle, and the lowest price for this Mac with AppleCare anywhere by $32, according to our Macs + AppleCare Price Guide. And as long as you do not live in NY state, B&amp;H won’t collect any sales tax on your order, which will add roughly another $100 in savings for a combined savings of over $233. For readers looking for absolute lowest price on just the MacBook Pro itself, MacMall also lists this model for $1,234.99 but offers AppleInsider readers an additional 3% off its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air prices when using the links in the Price Guides and then applying promo / coupon code APPLEINSIDER01. This drops the price to $1,197.94 — $102 off Apple’s retail price and the lowest price anywhere for this model. MacMall also only collects sales tax if you’re shipping your order to CA, CO, GA, IL, MN, NC, NY, TN, or WI. Another cost saving option is to consider a handful of closeout specials on the 2013 MacBook Pros that remain in Apple’s sales channel, given that these models are nearly identical in architecture and performance to the models released in 2014.

The part depicted in the photograph, which appeared on Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo, bears the same physical design as Apple’s current charging adapter in Australia. It is slightly wider than the current U.S. model, with notches on either side to allow a more solid grip when plugging and unplugging. There is no word on why Apple would make such a move, though it is possible that the company plans to increase the charger’s capacity above its current five watts. The so-called “iPhone 6” is rumored to ship with a battery some 46 percent larger than the battery in the iPhone 5s. Also shown is a new Lightning charging cable with a reversible, USB Type-A plug at one end. A number of similar items have shown up in recent days — and the company has been seen expressing interest in reversible designs — though this design would not be compliant with official USB specifications.

Building on early success with a deadbolt replacement solution, Apigy designed Lockitron as a standalone product that can be operated over the Internet via Wi-Fi, or directly from an iPhone through Bluetooth 4.0. Like many hardware startups, however, Apigy encountered a number of problems during manufacturing, missing deadlines due to unforeseen complications and quality control issues. Nearly two years after a successful crowd-funding campaign, Lockitron is finally shipping out to backers in quantity. Unfortunately, there are still problems with the current software and some promised features are noticeably absent. DesignWhile the basic dimensions of U.S. deadbolts are standardized, internal mechanics like the degree of rotation required to actuate the lock varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, Schlage requires a 90-degree turn to engage and disengage the bolt, whereas products made by Kwikset need a more substantial 120-degree turn. If adjusting for varying locking ratios wasn’t hard enough, some locks have a deadbolt lever located centrally in the decorative mounting plate, while others keep the pivot point off-center in the fascia’s lower third. To work around these roadblocks, Lockitron employs a sensor suite and motorized turning ring that automatically programs locking start and stop positions, determines appropriate force and can even be activated by knocking. A rubber insert grasps the deadbolt lever and can be cut or 3D printed for the perfect fit. As seen in the image above, Lockitron boasts a minimalist design, with a housing element made of sturdy metal covered by a glossy plastic faceplate and knob. Instead of running flush against the door, the top cover leaves about a centimeter of chassis showing. The recessed area hides indicator lights and a multifunction button, both of which are located on the unit’s right side. Installing LockitronMounting Lockitron is a straightforward process and in most cases only requires a Philips-head screwdriver (included) to install. Apigy provides a C-shaped mounting plate that goes between the door and decorative deadbolt plate to create a solid anchor onto which Lockitron can latch. The C-plate features grooves to match up with common deadbolts assemblies, as well as tabs that interlock with Lockitron’s chassis. Installing Lockitron: Loosen the deadbolt screws from the interior door. Slide the C plate behind the deadbolt decorative mounting plate. Fit the mounting plate into the appropriate groove on the C Plate to help center it for Lockitron. Tighten the deadbolt screws while making sure the lever turns with the least amount of resistance possible. Deadbolts are fiddly, doors are drilled with a decent amount of inaccuracy, and if everything isn’t lined up just right, you may have a lever that’s hard to turn. Take the time to get it as smooth as possible. Once all that’s done, hold the Lockitron at an angle to the door, slip it over the tabs on the C plate, rotate until it’s vertically straight up and down with the door edge, and it’s mounted. It sounds hard, but actually wasn’t bad — just took a bit of fiddling to get right. Next, we downloaded the app, which guided us through the process of setting up Lockitron’s software. After entering our Wi-Fi network credentials, the app asked to connect our Lockitron with Apigy’s cloud service by taking a picture of a barcode attached to the device chassis. This next part is pretty cool. How do you get a device that’s not on your Wi-Fi network, on your Wi-Fi network without a keyboard to enter in details? In Lockitron’s world, you aim your phone’s display at the upper right corner of Lockitron and the app flashes pattern of pulses captured by an onboard photo sensor. After setup we encountered our first problem. We started out using a Kwikset deadbolt we had on hand. Since the app doesn’t ask what type of deadbolt you have during initial setup, the default is to the smaller turning angle of Schlage locks, so the motor would never turn far enough to fully deploy the bolt. We went out and bought a Schlage lock to finish the install only to find out from Apigy support that a hidden setup webpage allows users to reprogram Lockitron’s turning radius. Doing so has a negative effect on battery life, but is necessary for Kwikset-type deadbolts. A better solution would to have the app query what deadbolt we were using, or whether we needed a wider turning radius, before finishing setup procedures. In useOnce Lockitron was installed and set up, we started to see the kinds of compromises Apigy made to get the product to market. For example, Lockitron currently relies on Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth for connectivity. Because Wi-Fi has a high energy cost on the included AA batteries, the firmware aggressively puts Lockitron to sleep to conserve power. Sleep/wake scheduling is seemingly arbitrary and manual activation is limited to turning the lock or knocking on the door. When leaving the house, this isn’t all bad. We unlock the door from inside, exit, pull the door closed, and it’s still awake from unlocking it. From there, we can open the app and swipe to lock. This is mostly reliable, although the app sometimes incorrectly displays that Lockitron is asleep. We end up standing in front of the door, tapping and swiping, waiting to hear the lock. This takes longer than just using a key, and is kind of annoying. We really had hoped to be able to sit in the car and lock the door, or even check the status and lock it if we’ve forgotten to lock it while we’re out, away from the house. If Lockitron had a consistent connection to the network, we’d have been able to do this. Returning home is equally difficult. Most people have to take out a key, insert it into the lock, and turn to open the door. Our former lock was a keypad deadbolt, so we had to enter a combination and open the door. Using Lockitron means we take out our phone, open the app, knock on the door, tap on the screen, swipe the screen, and unlock the door. The idea of knock-to-wake is good from a power management standpoint, but lousy when it comes to actually opening a door. If it were raining and we had to wait in the rain for the door to wake up, that’s a poor experience. ConclusionLockitron is a novel idea and the hardware definitely has potential, but the current execution is not quite up to snuff. Most troubling is the lack of quick access and remote monitoring, as these are the very features that make a smart lock smart. Bluetooth Low Energy or other low power system (z-wave with an ethernet-to-z-wave dongle at the router, not unlike the Peel universal remote control from a few years ago) would allow Lockitron to stay awake and accessible from the outside world, and not leave us with uncertainty over whether or not the door was locked. BLE has yet to be incorporated in any useful way, however. Apigy is constantly rolling out software updates for better Wi-Fi connectivity, modified wake/sleep patterns, higher app monitoring accuracy and better mechanical operation. The company also plans to activate “Sense,” a proximity-aware method of keyless entry based on Bluetooth 4.0 that was on the list of hyped features. Hopefully Apigy will make the necessary changes to make good on its promises, but with a host of currently deactivated or sometimes-working features, using Lockitron is more of a hassle than it’s worth. Pros: Easy install process Solid hardware with big potential Good app (when it works) Cons: Many features, including “Sense,” not yet active Poor sleep/wake cycling Remote lock monitoring is spotty Score: 2 out of 5 Where to buyLockitron is available for preorder through Apigy’s website for $179.

The new regions add to existing coverage in North America, Europe and the East Asia. First introduced in 2010 to serve Apple’s push in education, VPP offers registered schools and businesses up to a 50 percent discount when buying 20 or more copies of an app or iBook title. Bulk purchasing was made available to business class users in 2011 and has since become a major component in Apple’s pursuit of selling managed distribution solutions to corporate customers.

As noted by the program’s dedicated webpage, Apple discovered a “very small percentage” of iPhone 5 handsets may suffer from unexpectedly short battery life due to an unannounced issue presumably related to manufacturing. According to Apple, iPhone 5 units affected by the problem come from a batch sold between the product’s launch in September 2012 through January 2013. Owners who purchased their handset within that time period and are experiencing shortened battery life symptoms can check if their unit is eligible for replacement via Apple’s website. A serial number is needed to process the request. As with past replacement programs, users with affected iPhones will be required to take their handset in to an Apple Authorized Service Provider, Apple Store or send it off to Apple for examination prior to service in order to verify eligibility. Aside from determining whether an iPhone contains one of the known-faulty batteries, the phone must be in working order to be eligible for a part swap. Any damage that would make replacement of the battery difficult, like a cracked screen, would first need to be fixed, meaning the swap-out could come at a cost. For now, the initiative is limited to users in the U.S. and China, though coverage will be expanded to other countries on Aug. 29. Apple is extending the program to users with affected iPhone 5 batteries for two years after first retail sale or until Mar. 1, 2015, whichever provides longer coverage.

Secret says the forthcoming update, set for release next week, is meant to dissuade unwanted behavior, presumably meaning anonymous personal attacks. To help in the push for a more friendly experience, Secret will be updated with Flickr integration for a more robust set of background images, but in exchange users will be prohibited from using photos from their Camera Roll. Personalized backgrounds are still encouraged, however, and users can still upload posts with photos taken in real-time with the in-app camera. Buried as the last change, but perhaps most important, Secret outlines new rules on using names in posts: We’ve learned that the vast majority of great secrets don’t have names in them, and the few that do usually aren’t productive and can even be harmful. We’ve changed our position on the use of real names and, in addition to discouraging their use, we’re actively blocking posts containing names of private individuals whenever possible. We will invest heavily here to make sure the system improves over time. Since launch, Secret’s backend service has analyzed posts for names, but the company says its monitoring system has become sophisticated enough to detect “keywords, sentiment, and photos of people.” If a violation of network guidelines is discovered, Secret urges users to “re-think” the content before posting. Reviews are conducted automatically, but in some cases human team members will take a look at questionable posts. Finally, the upcoming version will also add a polling feature that turns posts into an interactive “Yes or No” question that plots answers on a simple circular graph. As posts can quickly spread across the network, Secret envisions polling to be a quick and powerful tool for near real-time feedback. In related news, Secret is at the center of a kerfuffle in Brazil, where a judge banned the app from the iOS and Android app stores over concerns of anonymous cyber-bullying. Citing Article 5 of Brazil’s constitution, which prohibits anonymous freedom of expression, the jurist gave Apple and Google ten days to remove Secret from their respective digital storefronts and remotely wipe the app from devices within the country. Apple reportedly complied with the order by pulling the app from Brazil’s App Store yesterday, but it is unclear if the company is willing to remotely disable already installed versions. While new Secret for iOS will roll out next week, the current iteration is available as a free 16.6MB download from the iOS App Store.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Coin 'connected credit card' for Apple's iOS devices delays launch to 2015","slug":"coin-connected-credit-card-for-apples-ios-devices-delays-launch-to-2015","date":"2014-08-21T19:21:41.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"21/08/2014/coin-connected-credit-card-for-apples-ios-devices-delays-launch-to-2015/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/21/08/2014/coin-connected-credit-card-for-apples-ios-devices-delays-launch-to-2015/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Friday, August 22, 2014, 12:21 pm PT (03:21 pm ET) By Sam OliverThe makers of Coin — a Bluetooth-enabled “connected card” designed to allow users to store magnetic stripe information for multiple credit and debit cards on a single device — on Friday announced that they would delay a full launch until next year, but would begin sending out 10,000 “beta” units to pre-order customers sooner. Coin’s executives cited manufacturing issues when explaining the delay, according toCNET. The device, announced last November, had been slated to ship this summer. At least 1,000 customers have already been issued preproduction Coin units, and the company will now expand that to at least 10,000 in lieu of a full launch. Backers should receive emails allowing them to claim their beta device in the next few days. Coin works by loading card information using a companion smartphone application and dongle which connects to the Coin via Bluetooth. Each Coin can store up to eight cards at a time in its onboard memory, and pressing a small button switches between cards and displays the currently-selected card an embedded e-ink screen. The device drew equal parts applause and skepticism when it was announced. The possibilities for increase convenience are apparent, but many pointed out possible security implications — including the possible financial harm thieves could do to a person by swiping a single Coin, rather than being forced to try for a full wallet. Additionally, others panned Coin for the lack of support for the emerging chip-and-signature standard that has begun to expand among U.S. card issuers. Coin CEO Kanishk Parashar said that the company has yet to begin exploring the addition of a chip, and is instead focused on launching its first version. “What we’ll do is that once we get through this first shipment of Coins, we’ll be able to have enough resources to do an R&amp;D project,” he told CNET.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Samsung ad challenges Apple's iPhone 5s to take 'ice bucket challenge'","slug":"samsung-ad-challenges-apples-iphone-5s-to-take-ice-bucket-challenge","date":"2014-08-21T18:12:13.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"21/08/2014/samsung-ad-challenges-apples-iphone-5s-to-take-ice-bucket-challenge/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/21/08/2014/samsung-ad-challenges-apples-iphone-5s-to-take-ice-bucket-challenge/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Friday, August 22, 2014, 11:12 am PT (02:12 pm ET) By AppleInsider StaffIn a short commercial posted Friday, South Korean electronics giant Samsung subjected its water-resistant Galaxy S5 smartphone to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which the handset’s S-Voice personal digital assistant called “freezing” before nominating Apple’s iPhone 5s and other competitors to do the same.

The tale of two very different platforms is told by the latest data from OpenSignal, which has tracked nearly 19,000 total distinct Android devices this year, up from just under 12,000 last year. Samsung remains the dominant maker of Android devices, with a 43 percent share, while the most popular Android hardware is its Galaxy S III smartphone. The plethora of device makers, many of which with their own custom skins and modifications to Android, only contribute to the fragmentation issue. And the number of distinct devices on the market tracked by OpenSignal has exploded from just 4,000 in its first report issued in 2012. When Android fragmentation is measured purely among Google’s major releases, the leading installation is 4.1 “Jelly Bean,” found on 26.5 percent of devices. Next is the most recent version of Android, 4.4 “Kit Kat,” with a 20.9 percent share. In total there are five different versions of Android with more than 10 percent of the market. The remaining three are 4.2 “Jelly Bean” (19.8 percent), 2.3.3-2.3.7 “Gingerbread” (13.6 percent), and 4.0.3-4.0.4 “Ice Cream Sandwich” (10.6 percent). Meanwhile, only one version of Apple’s iOS platform holds more than 10 percent share, and it’s not even close: iOS 7 is at 91 percent, while iOS 6 holds just 8 percent. Earlier versions of iOS account for only 1 percent of installations. Those figures align with Apple’s own App Store data detailed to developers on its website. The figures were most recently updated for a 7-day period ending Aug. 10, 2014. The OpenSignal data breaks down mobile operating system installations based on new application programming interfaces made available to developers, referring to it as “API fragmentation.” The data tracks the market share of the leading API level at any time, which peaked around 60 percent in mid-2012. Since then, the market share of the leading API level has steadily declined, and is now at an all-time low The data is also broken down for screen size fragmentation, another area where Apple has a key advantage over Android for developer simplicity. Apple’s iOS platform has been limited to four different physical screen sizes, thanks to Apple’s use of pixel-doubling when upgrading to Retina displays. On Android, though, there are countless different screen sizes, which OpenSignal said is “hugely challenging” for developers trying to create applications that can work well on a range of devices. For its latest report, OpenSignal surveyed 682,000 total devices running its app. The sample size was kept the same as its fragmentation reports from 2013 and 2012 for a fairer comparison.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Purportedly leaked data from Foxconn again points to 'iPhone 6' with protruding camera lens","slug":"purportedly-leaked-data-from-foxconn-again-points-to-iphone-6-with-protruding-camera-lens","date":"2014-08-21T13:08:17.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"21/08/2014/purportedly-leaked-data-from-foxconn-again-points-to-iphone-6-with-protruding-camera-lens/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/21/08/2014/purportedly-leaked-data-from-foxconn-again-points-to-iphone-6-with-protruding-camera-lens/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Friday, August 22, 2014, 06:08 am PT (09:08 am ET) By AppleInsider StaffA set of photographs published on Friday purport to show both 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch variants of Apple’s next-generation iPhone depicted in an engineering prototype overview, with both models sporting a protruding camera lens and all-metal rear casing. The 4.7-inch version of the so-called “iPhone 6” is said to measure 138 millimeters on the Y axis, 66 millimeters on the X axis, and 6.9 millimeters on the Z axis, while the 5.5-inch model compares at 158 millimeters, 78 millimeters, and 7.1 millimeters, respectively. The shots, first published by French blog iGen.fr, were supposedly taken from internal systems at Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn. At least one of the screens is identical to a render that emerged earlier this week from the Republic of China. Both of the handsets depicted add 0.77 millimeters on the Z axis for the external portion of the camera lens. Apple is said to have gone to great lengths in an attempt to bring the 5.5-inch model down to 7 millimeters in thickness, but was unable to do so. The company also reportedly shipped some 28 containers of displays from the U.S. to Foxconn plants in the People’s Republic of China.

The report said the latest issue comes “on the heels of a separate screen technology problem” that was associated with making the new screens thinner, but has apparently been resolved. The previous problem, according to two supply chain sources, centered around the backlight of the “iPhone 6,” which previously caused display production to be put on hold in June and July. Apple apparently wanted to use a single backlight module to make the screen as thin as possible, but the displays were not bright enough and Apple had to find a way to fit a second layer. Details on the latest issue, however, were scant, simply referring to a “key component.” Sources who spoke with the news outlet said it was “unclear” whether the problems could “delay the launch or limited the number of phones initially available to customers.” The report reaffirmed widely expected details about the next iPhone: That it will be unveiled Sept. 9, and it will come in screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches.

According to reports citing unsuccessful iTunes searches and sources, Apple supposedly removed Secret from the Brazilian App Store sometime today after a local judge ordered a ban on the app for violating national law. As Apple has not issued a statement on the matter, the removal is not official and could instead be a self-imposed takedown for maintenance. Apple and Google were hit with preliminary injunctions on Tuesday, with Judge Paulo Cesar de Carvalho calling for the companies to ban Secret from their respective app stores and remotely delete all installations in Brazil. The judge also lumped Windows Phone app Cryptic into his decision. At the time, the three companies were given ten days to comply with the order, after which time a fine of 20,000 Brazilian Real (about US$8,860) would be levied for each day the apps remain in service. Judge de Carvalho’s determination stems from a proposed action written by public prosecutor Marcelo Zenkner that looks to prevent cyber-bullying. Citing Article 5 of Brazil’s constitution, Zenkner claims apps like Secret violate the law by allowing anonymous freedom of expression that infringes on human rights. As for the second part of Judge de Carvalho’s order, it is unknown if Apple has or will add Secret to a so-called app “blacklist,” which would remotely disable the title by revoking its certificate. Apple’s iOS is not capable of remotely deleting apps, but it can render software inoperable. The iPhone, for example, periodically calls Apple’s servers to retrieve a list of verified app certificates. Using this information, iOS can weed out installed apps that are unverified or blacklisted.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"First Look: SETA stand for iPad with NanoSuction pads","slug":"first-look-seta-stand-for-ipad-with-nanosuction-pads","date":"2014-08-21T01:44:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"21/08/2014/first-look-seta-stand-for-ipad-with-nanosuction-pads/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/21/08/2014/first-look-seta-stand-for-ipad-with-nanosuction-pads/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 21, 2014, 06:44 pm PT (09:44 pm ET) By Mikey CampbellAfter finding Kickstarter success with an iPhone stand last year, 1.0 Innovations is looking to fund two super-sized models with more NanoSuction stick for iPads and phablets. Original smartphone SETA (left) next to the mid-size SETA 7. Like their iPhone forebear, which we covered in May 2013, the new SETA 7 and SETA 10 stands for iPad (and any other device with a non-porous rear shell) are simple in design. Fashioned out of thick matte coated aluminum bent into an “L” shape with a slight tilt for desktop usability, the stand’s austere aesthetic is limited to a large NanoSuction pad and a T-shaped cutout for wrangling Apple’s Lightning cable. The slot also handles MagSafe, USB and other miscellaneous connectors fairly well. The main features are two extra large NanoSuction pads — one on the face and a baseplate foot for table mounting — that allow for easy placement and quick device attachment and detachment without the need for extra hardware. The NanoSuction material, analogues of which are used in more mainstream accessories like BlueLounge’s Milo, is durable and offers a remarkably strong bond without leaving behind the residue of adhesives. We were able to spend some time with a production SETA 7, the smaller of the two new SETAs, and found the stand to work as advertised. Just like the original smartphone model, which we still use more than one year after purchase, the NanoSuction pads are extremely sticky and grab onto smooth surfaces with little to no force. For example, the stand will firmly secure itself to a table by its own weight. While the SETA 7 is designed for use with smaller tablet and phablet devices, and easily kept an iPad mini immobile in both portrait and landscape orientations during testing, its stickiness is more than adequate for a 9.7-inch iPad Air. We imagine the larger SETA 10 is even more eager to glom on to Apple’s slate, and the additional $5 cost is easy to swallow. But for us the smaller SETA 7 is strong enough to do the job and takes up less desk space. SETA 7 holding an iPad mini (left) and iPad Air. On a whole, SETA’s design translates well to tablets, though some may no appreciate the lack of adjustability. The preset angle is not a problem for us and works well when sitting at a desk, but we did have one quibble regarding device removal. Because the stand’s NanoSuction face pad is much larger than the one on its foot, dismounting an iPad would sometimes cause the entire stand to come off the table. After a few days of use plopped in the same spot, however, the problem subsided. It should be noted that the iPad-facing NanoSuction pad must be cleaned every few weeks depending on usage as dust and debris will “clog” the material over time. As with the original smartphone version, wiping the stand down with a wet cloth returns it to working order. With less than two weeks to go, SETA has raised nearly $8,000 of its $8,750 goal, though 1.0 Innovations has confirmed all rewards will ship in November regardless of where funding stands when the Kickstarter ends. Pricing starts at $49 for the SETA 7 and $54 for the SETA 10. As of this writing, there are two $45 “early bird” slots remaining for the SETA 7 and one $65 option for a set of both. Other rewards, like bundles with the original smartphone SETA stand, are also available through Kickstarter’s website.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Tim Cook visits veterans and doctors at Palo Alto VA hospital, staff using iPads","slug":"tim-cook-visits-veterans-and-doctors-at-palo-alto-va-hospital-staff-using-ipads","date":"2014-08-20T22:54:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"20/08/2014/tim-cook-visits-veterans-and-doctors-at-palo-alto-va-hospital-staff-using-ipads/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/20/08/2014/tim-cook-visits-veterans-and-doctors-at-palo-alto-va-hospital-staff-using-ipads/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 21, 2014, 03:54 pm PT (06:54 pm ET) By Mikey CampbellApple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday tweeted out a photo and brief message highlighting a recent visit to the Veterans Affairs hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., saying he was happy to meet with doctors who now use iPads to treat patients.

A big part of the iPad’s success in the field comes thanks to a healthy selection of industry apps. The iPad has curried favor as far back as 2011, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration green lit an app radiologists can use to view images and make mobile diagnoses. Cook’s visit comes one day after newly appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald surveyed the Palo Alto VA HCS as part of a nationwide tour of VA hospitals. As reported by the San Jose Mercury News, McDonald lauded the facility as being one of the best in the system. “Palo Alto VA medical center is one of the crown jewels of our healthcare system,” he said. “Every day, great care is delivered to veterans in every healthcare facility nationwide, but it’s especially evident here in Palo Alto and that’s why I’m here today.” America’s Veterans Affairs healthcare system was thrust into the spotlight after it was reported that veterans were receiving subpar care, some of whom supposedly died waiting for treatment. The revelations led to an investigation that found a system fraught with trouble. Falsification of records meant to cover up excessive wait times, incorrect diagnoses and other scandals came to light, ultimately forcing former VA head Eric Shinseki to tender his resignation. There has been no word as to the VA’s official stance on iPads and it is unknown if other facilities in the system use the tablet.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple updates iMovie for Mac, iWork suite for OS X and iOS with minor bug fixes [u]","slug":"apple-updates-imovie-for-mac-iwork-suite-for-os-x-and-ios-with-minor-bug-fixes-u","date":"2014-08-20T22:01:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"20/08/2014/apple-updates-imovie-for-mac-iwork-suite-for-os-x-and-ios-with-minor-bug-fixes-u/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/20/08/2014/apple-updates-imovie-for-mac-iwork-suite-for-os-x-and-ios-with-minor-bug-fixes-u/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 21, 2014, 03:01 pm PT (06:01 pm ET) By AppleInsider Staff In what appears to be a routine maintenance update, Apple on Thursday rolled out minor iWork app point releases for both Mac and iOS, bringing stability improvements and bug fixes to the company’s multi-platform productivity suite.

The publication cited a program instituted last year by British energy firm BP, in which the company offered employees the ability to earn health insurance discounts by making healthier life choices, as an example of the possibilities of such a partnership. Employees validate their progress by wearing a FitBit fitness tracker. UnitedHealth and Humana — along with competitors Cigna and Highmark — are said to have added similar options for policyholders. It is possible that the talks with Apple would fit under this rubric, as HealthKit is designed in part to allow medical professionals easier access to the data generated by the growing plethora of wearable devices available to consumers.

An iMessage spam message, via Wired A mid-July report from internet security firm Cloudmark singled out a campaign — likely run by Chinese spammers — directing iPhone users to sketchy online storefronts selling what appear to be counterfeit designer goods, such as Oakley sunglasses and Michael Kors clothing. Consumers appeared to have been targeted by geography, with those in Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, and New York City bearing the brunt of the assault. Cloudmark indicated that the campaign, conducted via iMessage, is so widespread that more than 3 of every 10 unsolicited SMS messages in the U.S. could be attributed to it. A followup article that appeared earlier this week in Wired — based on the same research — then decried iMessage as “being taken over by spammers.” There appears, however, to be little evidence to support those claims. A search of Apple’s user forums, generally among the first places iPhone owners go to vent their frustration in such situations, returns relatively few results related to iMessage spam. The threads that do exist rarely boast more than 20 replies. The internet holds few complaints of spam from iMessage users, even on Apple’s own user forums. Cloudmark itself has previously admitted that iMessage spam may be difficult to discern from SMS spam in their tracking database, which depends on users to send in unsolicited messages that they receive. Even when operating under the assumption that Cloudmark is properly identifying iMessage spam, the numbers hardly suggest that Apple’s service is being “taken over” by nefarious individuals. According to telecom industry research firm Heavy Reading, some 1.5 percent — or 120 billion — of the estimated 8 trillion SMS messages sent around the globe each year are unsolicited. That works out to around 328 million daily spam messages, of which Apple’s theoretical share would be nearly 100 million. Were this the case, it would hardly be enough to qualify iMessage as having been “taken over” by spammers. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company handles more than 2 billion iMessages each day, and earlier this year he revised that figure to “several billion.” At the lower figure, only about five percent of iMessages would be spam — assuming Cloudmark’s 30 percent figure is accurate. Of course, iMessage spam exists. Apple admitted as much last year with the release of a new support document detailing a process for reporting unwanted iMessages and the implementation of sending rate limits. “Taken over by spammers,” though, seems more than just a little hyperbolic.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Apple releases OS X Yosemite Public Beta 2, new iTunes 12 beta for testing","slug":"apple-releases-os-x-yosemite-public-beta-2-new-itunes-12-beta-for-testing","date":"2014-08-20T17:24:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"20/08/2014/apple-releases-os-x-yosemite-public-beta-2-new-itunes-12-beta-for-testing/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/20/08/2014/apple-releases-os-x-yosemite-public-beta-2-new-itunes-12-beta-for-testing/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 21, 2014, 10:24 am PT (01:24 pm ET) By AppleInsider Staff Apple on Thursday provided members of its public beta program the second test build of OS X Yosemite, while a new build of iTunes 12 for Yosemite is also available.

The concept is detailed in a filing made with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that was published on Thursday and discovered by AppleInsider. Entitled “Reversible USB Connector with Compliant Member to Spread Stress and Increase Contact Normal Force,” it describes a standard-size USB “Type-A” male plug that could be inserted in either direction. The filing is noteworthy because it comes as a number of new Lightning cables have appeared online, showing a reversible USB connector. This has sparked hopes that Apple might be planning to release such an accessory. However, such cables would not be complaint with the official USB specifications — a move that might give Apple pause. And considering that reversible, non-sanctioned USB plugs have been around for years, it’s possible that the leaked Lightning cables appearing online were made by third-party manufacturers and not Apple. Still, Apple has clearly shown internal interest in simplifying USB cables, as evidenced by the new patent application. The filing describes a USB Type-A plug that is “180-degree symmetrical” with a “double orientation design.” Apple notes that existing USB plug connectors include an insertion opening with features that prevent it from being plugged into a port the wrong way. But it states that it can be difficult for users to determine the correct orientation, even with appropriate markings indicating which side should be facing upward. “Users may incorrectly insert a plug connector into a corresponding receptacle connector, which may potentially result in damage to the connectors and/or user frustration,” the filing states. Apple says its own design could “reduce the potential for USB connector damage and user frustration” by allowing a cable to be plugged into a socket in either of two orientations. The concept also states that Apple could include structural support that would distribute stress, ensuring durability of the cable. Reversibility was one of the key design decisions behind Apple’s proprietary Lightning connection, which debuted in 2012 on the iPhone 5. It replaced the company’s 30-pin connection design, which, like sanctioned USB Type-A, could only be plugged into a socket in one direction. Photo via Sonny Dickson. The USB Compliance Committee does have a new forthcoming connector — USB Type-C — that will be reversible. But the new, smaller connector features an entirely new form factor, and is not the standard Type-A connector shown in Apple’s patent application or the recent cable leaks. The specifications for USB Type-C do not specify which type of plug must be on each end of a cable. That means that authorized Type-C to Type-C cables, or even Type-C to Lightning connectors, could become a reality, setting the stage for the USB Type-A plug to begin to fade away. Apple’s reversible Type-A USB connector patent, made public on Thursday, was first filed with the USPTO in February of this year. The proposed invention is credited to Warren Z. Jones, Eric T. Soohoo, Albert J. Golko, and Stephen Brian Lynch.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Disney expands 'Star Wars' iOS franchise with 'Commander' real-time strategy game","slug":"disney-expands-star-wars-ios-franchise-with-commander-real-time-strategy-game","date":"2014-08-20T13:13:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"20/08/2014/disney-expands-star-wars-ios-franchise-with-commander-real-time-strategy-game/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/20/08/2014/disney-expands-star-wars-ios-franchise-with-commander-real-time-strategy-game/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 21, 2014, 06:13 am PT (09:13 am ET) By AppleInsider Staff After soft-launching in the Australian iOS App Store nearly two months ago, Disney Interactive’s “Star Wars: Commander” saw wide release on Thursday, bringing real-time strategy “Rebellion vs. Empire” gameplay to Apple’s mobile devices.

Somewhat strangely, the document only mentions capacities of 16, 64 and 128 gigabytes, with no mention of a 32-gigabyte handset. Currently, Apple offers its flagship iPhone in a total of three capacities: 16, 32 and 64 gigabytes, each costing $100 more for double the storage. If Apple were to stick with three capacities but eliminate the 32-gigabyte model, it could offer more value and potentially upsell customers to more expensive models. Of course, it’s also possible that Apple will keep the 32-gigabyte variant around and sell its next iPhone at a total of four capacities. The company already employs this approach with both the iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display, both of which range from 16 gigabytes to 64. The leaked documents suggest the “iPhone 6” will have 16-gigabyte memory modules built by Toshiba and Hynix, while 64-gigabyte NAND components will come from Hynix, Toshiba and SanDisk. The leak alleges that the highest-capacity 128-gigabyte modules will come from Toshiba alone. One rumor that surfaced in June suggested that Apple might limit the option of 128 gigabytes of storage to its anticipated jumbo-sized 5.5-inch “iPhone 6.” This years iPhone update is expected to come in two larger screen sizes, with the second option being 4.7 inches.

Source: USPTO As published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple’s applications for “Automatic identification of vehicle location&amp;OS=ccl/340/989+and+pd/8/21/2014&amp;RS=(CCL/340/989+AND+PD/20140821))” and “Vehicle location in weak location signal scenarios&amp;OS=ccl/340/989+and+pd/8/21/2014&amp;RS=(CCL/340/989+AND+PD/20140821))” suggest the company is looking to integrate high-level vehicle-related functionality into iOS. Specifically, the filings outline a convenience feature that can automatically decide when a user parks their car, then save that position for later retrieval and on-foot navigation. The first step in Apple’s invention is to intelligently determine when and where a user parks. In one embodiment, the handset establishes a data connection with a compatible vehicle via any suitable means of communication, though Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE are described in detail. Some embodiments rely on the device-to-car connection to determine when a user enters or parks a vehicle. For example, when an initial pairing operation is complete, perhaps triggered by a “door open” signal or engine ignition, the system may decide the user has entered or is about to enter the car. In the same way, a disconnection may signal a user has turned the car off and is parked. With a Bluetooth connection, the car is able to transmit pertinent system information to the iPhone for more accurate determination. Other measures of deducing a vehicle’s operational state — whether the car is parked, in motion or undetermined — include sensor output from an iPhone’s accelerometer or GPS signal processing. Once a car is classified as parked, the system plots the position and continues to track a user’s movement as they walk away. In certain optimal scenarios, a mobile device would be in constant communication with a GPS signal, though this is not always possible due to natural and manmade obstructions. In lieu of GPS, the iPhone relies on onboard sensors to estimate with some accuracy the movement of a user. By combining sporadic GPS signal locks with accelerometer data, for example, an iPhone is able to “look forward” or “look backward” from a given point in time to deduce the location of a user proximate to their car. Any number of techniques may be applied for tracking purposes, like motion data processing, time stamps, gyroscope data, pedometer data and more. Perhaps most applicable in driving and walking scenarios is the accelerometer, which can be used to determine motion, direction and speed over time. Illustration showing user movement proximate to their car. Apple also notes that the above methods for device location determination during periods of weak signal reception can be applied while driving, especially helpful when traveling through canyons or areas with weak cell reception. Once outside the vehicle, an iPhone can track a user’s movement via GPS or any of the previously discussed methods. To find their way back to the parked car, users can ask Siri for directions with a simple command like, “Find my car.” In response, a map, GUI or audio directions are provided for quick navigation. It is unknown if Apple intends to implement the feature described above in a future iOS build, though the company has already announced work on advanced vehicle integration. Car Play was unveiled in 2013 and promises to bring iOS capabilities like Siri, navigation, iMessage and more to vehicle infotainment systems. An integrated parked car mapping solution would be a good fit, but evidence of a rollout has yet to surface. Apple’s automatic car parking and navigation patent applications were first filed for in February 2013 and credit Jason A. Skinder, Stephen O. Lemay, Bradford A. Moore, Seejo K. Pylappan, Christopher Blumenberg, Marcel van Os and Devrim Varoglu as their inventors.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Purported 'iPad Air 2' flex cables revealed in new photos","slug":"purported-ipad-air-2-flex-cables-revealed-in-new-photos","date":"2014-08-20T09:45:00.000Z","updated":"2016-03-27T21:02:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"20/08/2014/purported-ipad-air-2-flex-cables-revealed-in-new-photos/","link":"","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/20/08/2014/purported-ipad-air-2-flex-cables-revealed-in-new-photos/","excerpt":"","keywords":null,"text":"Thursday, August 21, 2014, 02:45 am PT (05:45 am ET) By AppleInsider Staff In what could be the first images of internal components destined for Apple’s iPad Air refresh, fresh photos out of the Far East reportedly show a batch of flex cables including easily recognizable antennas for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. The largest of the purported “iPad Air 2” parts, seen above, appears to consist of multiple flex cables related to the tablet’s communications package. More specifically, comparing the component to current iPad Air flex cables, the long central part is likely a Bluetooth/Wi-Fi antenna assembly, while the smaller offshoot on the left could be a GPS antenna. According to French language blog iPhonote, the photos come second-hand from an anonymous source with connections to a Shenzhen parts supplier. As such, AppleInsider cannot vouch for the photos’ veracity. The closeup of the purported GPS antenna (left most photo in gallery below) shows minor tweaks in the metal shielding structure, though the shape of the part remains the same as current design. This jibes with rumors saying that Apple will keep external aesthetics, as well as internal layout, largely the same. Today’s report also claims to show flex cables for what is thought to be a redesigned microphone connector and an unknown grounded interconnect. Finally, the publication posted a few images of what is believed to be a display assembly bound for the 4.7-inch “iPhone 6,” though the photos reveal no new information. * Rumors relating to the iPad Air 2 have been few and far between, though supposed parts are starting to “leak” out of China. Earlier this month, a report claimed to reveal the tablet’s rear shell, highlighting minute changes in design like larger speaker holes and recessed volume buttons. On Wednesday, a rumor claimed Apple is planning to bump onboard RAM to 2GB for the second-gen iPad Air, while leaving the current 1GB of RAM for the next iPad mini with Retina display. A launch date is unknown, though Apple could take the opportunity to unveil the device at an expected iPhone launch event on Sept. 9. A more likely debut would be in October, the same month Apple chose to reveal the first iPad Air in 2013.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"MacOS","slug":"macos","permalink":"http://fe.myfreebsd.co.uk/categories/macos/"}],"tags":[]}]}
