<span>Following a spate of rumors that late-term problems with the display on Apple's next-generation iPhone could force the handset's delay or seriously constrain supplies, at least one Wall Street analyst indicated that the issue — if it even actually exists — would not materially impact the launch of the so-called "iPhone 6."

"This sounds like a typical late-in-the-game supply chain story that turns out to have no impact on launch dates or devices sales," J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall wrote in a Monday morning note to investors which was provided to _AppleInsider._ "We believe that initial supply could be slowed somewhat if there is any truth to this but we doubt that iPhone unit volumes in the fall are likely to be impacted."

Apple suppliers were "scrambling to get enough screens ready" for the launch, _Reuters_[reported](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/22/display-manufacturing-for-apples-iphone-6-need-last-minute-redesign-reuters-says) last week. Two issues — one said to revolve around backlight technology, and another referred to only as involving a "key component" — were pegged as having a potentially serious impact on Apple's plans.

At the time, it was "unclear" whether the problems could "delay the launch or limited the number of phones initially available to customers," the outlet said.

As for the track record for _Reuters_, the news publication also claimed [last year](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/02/reuters-retina-ipad-mini-may-not-launch-in-2013-due-to-supply-constraints) that Apple's iPad mini with Retina display may not arrive until 2014 due to alleged supply constraints. Of course, that report ended up being erroneous, as the high-resolution iPad mini launched last year without issue.

As has become customary in the lead-up to the release of a new Apple product, the "iPhone 6" has been the subject of numerous delay rumors. Most have revolved around the potential pushback of a 5.5-inch "phablet" variant, which is believed to remain on track but [may not](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/13/analyst-ming-chi-kuo-apples-55-inch-iphone-6-faces-production-issues-launch-may-be-pushed-to-2015) make an appearance at the company's rumored Sept. 9 special media event.

Apple is expected to launch its next iPhone in two screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches. If the company sticks to its usual release pattern, it will launch the "iPhone 6" two Fridays after its unveiling, which this year would fall on Sept. 19\.
