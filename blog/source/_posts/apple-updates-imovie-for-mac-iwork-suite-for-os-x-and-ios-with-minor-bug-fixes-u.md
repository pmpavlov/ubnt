With the updates, [Pages](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8), [Numbers](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id361304891?mt=8) and [Keynote](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8) for iOS move to version 2.2.2, while Mac versions were bumped to 5.2.2 for [Pages](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12) , 3.2.2 for [Numbers](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id409203825?mt=12) and 6.2.2 for [Keynote](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id409183694?mt=12).

The last substantial iWork overhaul came [in April](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/01/apple-updates-iwork-for-ios-os-x-and-icloud-with-graphics-tweaks-design-tweaks) when the app suite received multiple user interface tweaks and feature additions in an effort to build a more cohesive [multi-platform experience](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/24/apple-updates-iwork-for-icloud-with-persistent-document-settings-new-tips-more). Later that month, an across-the-board [update](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/22/apple-updates-iwork-apps-for-ios-with-stability-improvements-and-bug-fixes) for iOS versions brought similar unspecified bug fixes and performance improvements seen in today's release.

While Pages, Numbers and Keynote have been Mac staples for many years, Apple first released its iWork for iOS [in 2011](http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/05/31/apple_releases_pages_keynote_and_numbers_for_iphone_and_ipod_touch) and has since expanded offerings [into iCloud](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/01/apple-updates-iwork-for-ios-os-x-and-icloud-with-graphics-tweaks-design-tweaks). 

Apple's iWork updates can be downloaded for free from the iOS or Mac App Stores, as well as Software Update. Users who have recently purchased a new Mac — or iOS device after [Sept. 10, 2013](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/09/10/apple-makes-iwork-iphoto-and-imovie-free-with-new-ios-devices) — can grab the apps for free from their respective App Stores. Customers with older iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models need to shell out $9.99 per app, while those using older Macs can buy Pages, Numbers and Keynote for $19.99 each. 

**Update:** Apple has also issued a [small update](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12) for the Mac version of iMovie that brings iCloud compatibility improvements for iMovie Theater. The updated app can be downloaded or purchased for $14.99 from the Mac App Store.
