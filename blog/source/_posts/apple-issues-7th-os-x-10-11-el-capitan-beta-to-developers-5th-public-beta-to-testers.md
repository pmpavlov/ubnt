Today's developer beta build comes [over two weeks](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/03/apple-issues-sixth-beta-of-os-x-el-capitan-to-developers) after Apple issued its most recent El Capitan version with a batch of bug fixes. The latest build is thought to contain additional performance enhancements and tweaks. 

The fifth public beta build initially went out [yesterday](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/18/fifth-build-of-os-x-1011-el-capitan-supplied-to-apples-public-beta-developers), but was quickly pulled for unknown reasons. 

With a rumored iPhone event coming up in September, Apple is likely finished with major feature additions and is putting the final touches on El Capitan before public release. While not a dramatic upgrade over Yosemite, El Capitan will add niceties like Split View, enhanced Mission Control and performance improvements.

Developers can download the seventh El Capitan beta via Apple's [Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com) or the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store.
