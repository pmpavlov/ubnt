<span>An unsourced photo that surfaced Saturday from Asia indicates that Apple may be planning to redesign the iPhone charging adapter — at least in the U.S. — alongside the release of its next-generation handset, which is expected to sport a larger battery that may include increased charging requirements.

The part depicted in the photograph, which [appeared](http://weibo.com/3068314592/BjBmeBhh3?mod=weibotime) on Chinese microblogging site _Sina Weibo_, bears the same physical design as Apple's current charging adapter in Australia. It is slightly wider than the current U.S. model, with notches on either side to allow a more solid grip when plugging and unplugging. 

There is no word on why Apple would make such a move, though it is possible that the company plans to increase the charger's capacity above its current five watts. The so-called "iPhone 6" is rumored to [ship](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/06/rumor-iphone-6-to-feature-2100mah-battery-46-increase-from-iphone-5s) with a battery some 46 percent larger than the battery in the iPhone 5s.

Also shown is a new Lightning charging cable with a reversible, USB Type-A plug at one end. A number of similar items have shown up in recent days — and the company has been seen expressing [interest](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/21/apples-interest-in-reversible-usb-plugs-detailed-in-new-patent-application) in reversible designs — though this design would not be compliant with official USB specifications.

Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 6 at a media event on Sept. 9, with availability likely to begin on Sept. 19\.
