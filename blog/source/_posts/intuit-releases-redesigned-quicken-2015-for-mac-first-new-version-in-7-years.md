The [new version of Quicken](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1989299-11248299) maintains many of the features found in previous releases, though some have been omitted. Among those missing are the ability to create a 12-month budget, show loan amortization, and pay bills directly within the application. 

In addition, functionality that has long been a part of Quicken's Windows version — such as multi-currency conversion and advanced investment options — has yet to cross the operating system divice. Intuit is allowing customers to [vote](http://www.quicken.com/mac/compare) on which features will be added next, and the company says that they will be provided as free updates.

Quicken 2015 for Mac also sports an updated design, reminiscent of Apple's new "flat" design direction in OS X Yosemite.

Intuit's free companion app for iOS will also work with the new Mac version, allowing users to synchronize data and monitor account balances and budgets from their iPhone or iPad. The app will also let users take pictures of receipts to track purchases.

The last major Mac version of Quicken was released in 2007, and the company unveiled a stripped-down "essentials" product in 2010\. Users of previous Quicken for Mac and Quicken for Windows versions, as well as Quicken Essentials for Mac, will be able to import their data to Quicken 2015\. 

Quicken 2015 for Mac is available directly from [Quicken.com](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1989299-11248299) for $74.99\. Quicken Money Management for iOS is a free, 20.6-megabyte [download](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quicken-2014-2015-money-management/id701067522?mt=8) from the App Store.
