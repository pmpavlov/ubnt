<span>Adding to the pile of rumors suggesting NFC hardware will be built into the next iPhone, a report on Friday narrows down the as-yet-unannounced component's source to Dutch chipmaker NXP, the same firm that supplies Apple with the M7 coprocessor.

Citing people familiar with Apple's plans, the _Financial Times_ reports the company has been [working with](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ee42ad02-2f32-11e4-afe4-00144feabdc0.html) NXP on contactless mobile payment system based on near-field communication technology, possibly tied to users' iTunes accounts. According to hardware analysis firm Chipworks, NXP already has a [significant presence](http://www.chipworks.com/en/technical-competitive-analysis/resources/blog/inside-the-iphone-5s/) in Apple's iOS device lineup as the Dutch chipmaker supplies the iPhone 5s' M7 motion coprocessor.

As credit card theft still a major problem around the world, companies like Visa and Mastercard are moving toward more secure solutions, specifically chip-and-PIN POS systems — which happen to include support for certain NFC-based standards — that should roll out across their respective networks by October 2015, the report says.

Apple holds a number of patents relating to NFC payments solutions and the company has long been rumored to be looking to introduce such capability in its iOS device lineup. On Thursday, a pair of reports claimed the iPhone 6 would be the first Apple device [to sport](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/28/rumor-apple-to-enter-mobile-payment-space-with-nfc-enabled-iphone-6) an NFC chip, to be leveraged for [digital wallet](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/28/apples-iphone-6-to-supposedly-incorporate-nfc-new-secure-enclave-for-mobile-payments) purposes. 

It remains unclear if Apple's mobile payments plans will rely solely on NFC, though such a scenario seems unlikely given that its massive installed iOS device user base would be left out unless they upgrade to new hardware. Successfully introducing a new form of payment means wide adoption consumer adoption. One possible stopgap could be a hybrid setup using either on-board NFC or, if the user does not own a new iPhone, a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless data.

Along with digital wallet capabilities, today's report claims NXP's chip may also be used to bolster the next-generation iPhone's compatibility with the so-called "internet of things," a catchall phrase describing connected devices like health trackers to app-powered home appliances. The forthcoming iOS 8 mobile operating system bound for Apple's "iPhone 6" does include a powerful framework for smart home products [called HomeKit](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/02/apple-introduces-homekit-framework-for-connected-homes), which could theoretically support NFC-equipped products. 

Apple is expected to announce its new iPhone lineup at a special event [on Sept. 9](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/28/apple-announces-sept-9-event-for-expected-iphone-6-iwatch-unveiling-wish-we-could-say-more), which according to multiple reports will also include the unveiling of an "iWatch" wearable device. _AppleInsider_ will offering live on-site coverage of the event next week.
