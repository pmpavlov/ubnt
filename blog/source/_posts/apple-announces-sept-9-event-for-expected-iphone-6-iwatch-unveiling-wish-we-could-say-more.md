<span>Breaking</span> By [AppleInsider Staff ](mailto:news@appleinsider.com)
<span>Apple on Thursday confirmed that it will hold a media event on Sept. 9, with a teaser sent to members of the media showcasing the date and a teasing tagline that reads: "Wish we could say more."

In a change from years past, Apple's 2014 September event will be held at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, Calif. Apple typically holds its annual iPhone event at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco, but this year's venue is closer to the company's corporate headquarters and can also accommodate three times as many people.

The Tuesday event will begin at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern. _AppleInsider_ will be there with full, live coverage.

In addition to the "iPhone 6," Apple is also expected to unveil a [brand new wearable device](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/27/apple-expected-to-unveil-iwatch-alongside-iphone-6-at-sept-9-event) at this year's event. The hardware is rumored to be a wrist-worn accessory that has come to be known as the "iWatch."

Word of the anticipated inclusion of the "iWatch" at the event leaked this week and is somewhat of a surprise, as it was originally expected that the device would be unveiled later this year. The Sept. 9 event date was [first reported](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/05/apple-to-hold-iphone-6-media-event-on-sept-9-report) by _Re/code_ earlier this month.

Unsurprising, however, is the likely unveiling of the "iPhone 6," as the event will come almost exactly one year after the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c were revealed. This year's iPhone upgrade is rumored to come in two screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches with a faster next-generation "A8" processor.

If Apple follows its usual release schedule, the new iPhone would find its way into the hands of consumers starting the following Friday, Sept. 19\. With a plethora of [parts leaks](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/26/rumored-circular-true-tone-flash-for-47-and-55-iphone-6-detailed-in-new-photos) surfacing in recent weeks, particularly for the purported 4.7-inch model, it's believed that Apple is already ramping up production of the "iPhone 6."

Less certain, however, is when the "iWatch" might become available. As of yet, there have been no parts leaked for the expected wearable accessory, and rumored details about the device's design [have been inconsistent](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/15/rumor-apples-iwatch-will-come-in-two-sizes-three-models-when-it-launches-this-fall) on everything from shape to screen size.

It's also likely that iOS 8, Apple's next-generation operating system, will launch to the public not long after the Sept. 9 event. If the company follows the same pattern as last year, iOS 8 would become available to the public on Wednesday, Sept. 17\.
