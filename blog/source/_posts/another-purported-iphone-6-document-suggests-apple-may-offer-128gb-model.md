<span>Apple's next iPhone could be the company's highest-capacity handset yet, with new documents suggesting the company could offer a whopping 128 gigabytes of capacity in its so-called "iPhone 6."

Word of a new iPhone with 128 gigabytes of NAND flash built by Toshiba first appeared in a pair of documents [obtained by](http://www.weibo.com/p/1001593746053840081450) GeekBar, and [spotlighted](http://www.gforgames.com/gadgets/leaked-iphone-6-schematic-confirms-128gb-version-44909/) Thursday by _G for Games_. Somewhat strangely, the document only mentions capacities of 16, 64 and 128 gigabytes, with no mention of a 32-gigabyte handset.

Currently, Apple offers its flagship iPhone in a total of three capacities: 16, 32 and 64 gigabytes, each costing $100 more for double the storage. If Apple were to stick with three capacities but eliminate the 32-gigabyte model, it could offer more value and potentially upsell customers to more expensive models.

Of course, it's also possible that Apple will keep the 32-gigabyte variant around and sell its next iPhone at a total of four capacities. The company already employs this approach with both the iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display, both of which range from 16 gigabytes to 64.

The leaked documents suggest the "iPhone 6" will have 16-gigabyte memory modules built by Toshiba and Hynix, while 64-gigabyte NAND components will come from Hynix, Toshiba and SanDisk. The leak alleges that the highest-capacity 128-gigabyte modules will come from Toshiba alone.

One rumor that surfaced [in June](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/26/rumor-apple-to-limit-128gb-iphone-6-option-to-55-inch-model) suggested that Apple might limit the option of 128 gigabytes of storage to its anticipated jumbo-sized 5.5-inch "iPhone 6." This years iPhone update is expected to come in two larger screen sizes, with the second option being 4.7 inches.

All is expected to be revealed [on Sept. 9](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/05/apple-to-hold-iphone-6-media-event-on-sept-9-report), when Apple is reportedly planning a media event to officially unveil the "iPhone 6." If the company sticks with its usual release pattern, it would become available to the public to purchase the following Friday, Sept. 19\.
