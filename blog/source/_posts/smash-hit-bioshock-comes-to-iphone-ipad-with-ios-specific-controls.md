As reported in [early August](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/04/console-hit-bioshock-coming-to-apples-iphone-ipad-this-summer), [_BioShock_](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id871629757?mt=8) for iOS is a full port of the original game first released for Windows PCs and Xbox in 2007\. 

Set in 1960, the game's protagonist Jack crash lands his plane near a gateway to Rapture, an underwater Utopia created by businessman Andrew Ryan. After discovering a powerful plasmid dubbed ADAM, the city fell into turmoil, creating roving bands of genetically modified inhabitants locked in a struggle for power.

Blending frenetic FPS gameplay with role-playing elements, _BioShock_ is driven by an intriguing storyline layered with philosophical undertones, the most influential being Ayn Rand's Objectivism. When the title first launched, critics lauded the novel application of decision-based gameplay in which a player's actions determine the story's final outcome.

From the release notes: 

*   Biologically modify your body with plasmids - genetic augmentations that empower you with dozens of fantastic abilities.
*   Control the world by hacking devices - reprogram enemy security bots into personal bodyguards, modify vending machines to change prices, and transform machine gun security turrets into powerless pieces of metal.
*   Upgrade your weapons - Craft variants of ammo and plasmids by picking up materials in the city to modify them at kiosks.

*   Explore Rapture - an incredible and unique art deco world hidden deep under the ocean, vividly illustrated with realistic water effects and cutting edge graphics now playable on mobile.

*   Make Meaningful Decisions - do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture to save yourself...or risk all to become their savior?
 The FPS horror title spawned two sequels in _BioShock 2_ and _BioShock: Infinite_.
