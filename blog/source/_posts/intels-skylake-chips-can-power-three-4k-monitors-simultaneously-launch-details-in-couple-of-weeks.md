The company in the meantime shared a [variety of details](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2972823/components-processors/intel-skylake-laptop-cpus-should-use-less-power-run-faster-and-can-even-drive-three-4k-monitors.html) about the platform, according to _PCWorld_. Skylake processors will, for instance, use a technology called Speed Shift to dynamically change power state and reduce consumption. 

Planned performance boosts are [already well-known](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/07/24/leaked-intel-skylake-info-reveals-future-macbooks-will-gain-graphics-boosts-better-battery-life), but one improvement will come in the form of "eDRAM+," a fully coherent form of cache memory that can work for the CPU and not just integrated graphics. eDRAM+ will also be used in more chips than eDRAM, and in 64- and 128-megabyte sizes.

A new extension technology, SGX — Software Guard eXtensions — should limit the potential damage of privileged malware attacks. 

Graphically, Intel claimed that Skylake's graphics technology will be powerful enough to drive three 4K monitors at 60 hertz, versus a single 4K monitor with Broadwell chips. 

Skylake processors are expected to drive the next generation of Apple Macs, from the [MacBook Air](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/11/leaked-intel-skylake-u-roadmap-reveals-cpus-likely-bound-for-macbook-air-) through to the iMac. Most updates will probably have to wait until next year however, since Skylake is only debuting later this year and most Macs have already seen a 2015 refresh
