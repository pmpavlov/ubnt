<span>A set of photographs published on Friday purport to show both 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch variants of Apple's next-generation iPhone depicted in an engineering prototype overview, with both models sporting a protruding camera lens and all-metal rear casing.

The 4.7-inch version of the so-called "iPhone 6" is said to measure 138 millimeters on the Y axis, 66 millimeters on the X axis, and 6.9 millimeters on the Z axis, while the 5.5-inch model compares at 158 millimeters, 78 millimeters, and 7.1 millimeters, respectively. The shots, first [published](http://www.igen.fr/iphone/2014/08/dimensions-poids-design-les-choix-dapple-pour-liphone-6-87272) by French blog _iGen.fr_, were supposedly taken from internal systems at Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn.

At least one of the screens is identical to a [render](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/20/purported-iphone-6-render-shows-sub-1mm-rear-camera-lens-protrusion) that emerged earlier this week from the Republic of China.

Both of the handsets depicted add 0.77 millimeters on the Z axis for the external portion of the camera lens. Apple is said to have gone to great lengths in an attempt to bring the 5.5-inch model down to 7 millimeters in thickness, but was unable to do so.

The company also reportedly shipped some 28 containers of displays from the U.S. to Foxconn plants in the People's Republic of China. Though speculation exists that these may have come from Apple's sapphire plant in Arizona, Gorilla Glass is also made in the U.S. by Corning. 

Apple is rumored to be planning the unveiling of at least one of the new models — likely the 4.7-inch variant, with a 5.5-inch "phablet" to follow — at an event on Sept. 9\. The new devices would then likely go on sale Sept. 19\.
