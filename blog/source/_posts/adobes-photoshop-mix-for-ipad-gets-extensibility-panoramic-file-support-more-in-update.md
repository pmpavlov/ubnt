[_Photoshop Mix_](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-mix/id885271158?mt=8) version 1.1 builds on Adobe's [June release](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/18/hands-on-adobes-lightroom-for-iphone-photoshop-mix-for-ipad-take-powerful-image-editing-mobile) with a few key features that tie the app more closely with mature Creative Suite offerings like [Photoshop Express](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/09/13/photoshop-express-gets-new-filters-chrome-ios-learns-pronouns). 

Introduced as part of the update is Image Swap, which lets users quickly rearrange layers in a project by dragging-and-dropping thumbnails of a selected image. Round-trip editing is now available with Photoshop Express, meaning users can create quick compositions using edited photos all within the Creative Cloud ecosystem.

Users can also save full resolution JPEG and PNG files — with masking data attached — locally on an iPad's Camera Roll, while Dropbox compatibility allows import of images saved in the cloud.

Finally, UI tweaks like three-level "undo" and "redo" options have been added to the latest app version. 

_Photoshop Mix_ is available as a [free 97.6MB download](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-mix/id885271158?mt=8) from the iOS App Store. The app requires Adobe's latest Lightroom 5.5 for Mac and one of the following Creative Cloud Subscriptions:
