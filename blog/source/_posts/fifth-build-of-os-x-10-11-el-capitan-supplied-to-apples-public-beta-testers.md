Members of Apple's public beta program can now download the update via the Mac App Store. Because it is pre-release software with bugs yet to be resolved, Apple advises users not to run El Capitan as their main operating system.

Users can [opt in](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome) to Apple's Beta Software Program at the company's website. It's available for both OS X and iOS.

Tuesday's update arrives [two weeks](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/04/apple-releases-fourth-public-beta-of-os-x-1011-el-capitan) after the fourth public beta of OS X 10.11\. The new public beta release is a somewhat strange move for Apple, arriving before an anticipated new developer beta.

Developers remain on their [sixth beta](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/03/apple-issues-sixth-beta-of-os-x-el-capitan-to-developers) of OS X El Capitan, which was released on Aug. 3 — one day before the fourth public beta became available.

OS X 10.11 El Capitan is somewhat of a polish of last year's OS X 10.10 Yosemite update, refining things that were previously introduced. However, there are a handful of new features in the next-generation Mac update, including Split View, a better Mission Control, and various performance improvements such as Metal graphics processing.
