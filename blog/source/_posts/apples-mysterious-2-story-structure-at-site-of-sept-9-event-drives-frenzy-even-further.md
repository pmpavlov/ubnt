<span>Following Apple's announcement that it would move its September media event — at which both the "iPhone 6" and "iWatch" are said to be unveiled — from the company's typical event stage in San Francisco to much larger space in Cupertino, new photos show that they have also constructed a bespoke two-story building on the grounds likely dedicated to the event.

Photos depict a large, square, all-white building — though its coloring could be merely the result of a screen put in place during construction — just outside Cupertino's Flint Center. Security is "very tight" on the premises, [according to](http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/28/pictures-apple-constructs-its-own-building-at-flint-center-for-sept-event/)_The Loop's_ Jim Darlymple.

It is unclear exactly what the space will be used for, but it likely to be part of the "hands on" area where Apple traditionally allows journalists to fondle new products following their announcement. The Flint Center has a capacity of nearly 3,000 people, compared to just over 700 for the oft-used Yerba Buena Center, suggesting that Apple could be preparing for an extremely important launch.

Apple [announced](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/28/apple-announces-sept-9-event-for-expected-iphone-6-iwatch-unveiling-wish-we-could-say-more) the event — to be held at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern — earlier Thursday. The invitation bore an equally mysterious tagline: "Wish we could say more."

At least one model of the next-generation iPhone will likely be shown off, as well as Apple's entrant into the suddenly-smoldering wearable device market. _AppleInsider_ will be on hand for the event and will bring live coverage from the Flint Center.
