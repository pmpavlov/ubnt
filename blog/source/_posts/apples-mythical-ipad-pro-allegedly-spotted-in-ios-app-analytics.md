<span itemprop="articleBody" readability="20"><span>A new, high-resolution iPad with an as-yet-unseen model identifier has reportedly begun to surface in analytics data from some commercial iOS apps, suggesting that the long-rumored "iPad Pro" may have entered the later stages of testing.

Analytics firm Appsee, which provides tools for developers to collect data on in-app user behavior, [said](https://www.appsee.com/blog/technology/the-ipad-pro-is-real-and-its-size-is-2048x2732) that they spotted a new iPad identified as model "iPad6,8" in their user logs. The iPad Air 2 bears model identifiers "iPad5,3" and "iPad5,4" for Wi-Fi and cellular versions, respectively.

The device Appsee found also sports a larger 2,048-pixel-by-2,732-pixel display, compared to the 2,048-pixel-by-1,536-pixel unit found on the newest iPads. That matches with references [found in](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/15/ios-9-code-suggests-2732-by-2048-pixel-display-for-129-inch-ipad-pro) developer previews of iOS 9 earlier this summer.

The iPad Pro is one of the most oft-rumored Apple devices, with numerous alleged stops and starts in recent years. In July, Apple was [said to](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/07/13/rumor-apple-cautious-in-placing-orders-for-late-2015-launch-of-129-ipad-pro) have begun placing 'cautious' orders for jumbo iPad, with availability expected just before Christmas.

Apple is thought to be planning a special event for Sept. 9 at which the company will likely unveil its next-generation iPhones, though it's unclear whether new iPads will also be shown off. Apple has historically held new iPad events in October, a move it could replicate this year if the iPad Pro is ready for release.
