<span>After finding Kickstarter success with an iPhone stand last year, 1.0 Innovations is looking to fund two super-sized models with more NanoSuction stick for iPads and phablets.

Like their iPhone forebear, which we covered [in May 2013](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/05/30/first-look-seta-stand-for-iphone-ipad-is-first-to-use-nanosuction-grip), the [new SETA 7 and SETA 10](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/774823150/setatm-tablet-stand-for-ipad-note-galaxy-nexus-asu) stands for iPad (and any other device with a non-porous rear shell) are simple in design. Fashioned out of thick matte coated aluminum bent into an "L" shape with a slight tilt for desktop usability, the stand's austere aesthetic is limited to a large NanoSuction pad and a T-shaped cutout for wrangling Apple's Lightning cable. The slot also handles MagSafe, USB and other miscellaneous connectors fairly well. 

The main features are two extra large NanoSuction pads — one on the face and a baseplate foot for table mounting — that allow for easy placement and quick device attachment and detachment without the need for extra hardware. The NanoSuction material, analogues of which are used in more mainstream accessories like [BlueLounge's Milo](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LNM1XU/?tag=reality), is durable and offers a remarkably strong bond without leaving behind the residue of adhesives. 

We were able to spend some time with a production SETA 7, the smaller of the two new SETAs, and found the stand to work as advertised. Just like the original smartphone model, which we still use more than one year after purchase, the NanoSuction pads are extremely sticky and grab onto smooth surfaces with little to no force. For example, the stand will firmly secure itself to a table by its own weight. 

While the SETA 7 is designed for use with smaller tablet and phablet devices, and easily kept an iPad mini immobile in both portrait and landscape orientations during testing, its stickiness is more than adequate for a 9.7-inch iPad Air. We imagine the larger SETA 10 is even more eager to glom on to Apple's slate, and the additional $5 cost is easy to swallow. But for us the smaller SETA 7 is strong enough to do the job and takes up less desk space.

On a whole, SETA's design translates well to tablets, though some may no appreciate the lack of adjustability. The preset angle is not a problem for us and works well when sitting at a desk, but we did have one quibble regarding device removal. Because the stand's NanoSuction face pad is much larger than the one on its foot, dismounting an iPad would sometimes cause the entire stand to come off the table. After a few days of use plopped in the same spot, however, the problem subsided.

It should be noted that the iPad-facing NanoSuction pad must be cleaned every few weeks depending on usage as dust and debris will "clog" the material over time. As with the original smartphone version, wiping the stand down with a wet cloth returns it to working order.

With less than two weeks to go, SETA has raised nearly $8,000 of its $8,750 goal, though 1.0 Innovations has confirmed all rewards will ship in November regardless of where funding stands when the Kickstarter ends. Pricing [starts at $49](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/774823150/setatm-tablet-stand-for-ipad-note-galaxy-nexus-asu) for the SETA 7 and $54 for the SETA 10\. As of this writing, there are two $45 "early bird" slots remaining for the SETA 7 and one $65 option for a set of both. Other rewards, like bundles with the original smartphone SETA stand, are also available through Kickstarter's website.
