<span>After soft-launching in the Australian iOS App Store nearly two months ago, Disney Interactive's "Star Wars: Commander" saw wide release on Thursday, bringing real-time strategy "Rebellion vs. Empire" gameplay to Apple's mobile devices.

Set in the _Star Wars_ universe during the "Galactic Civil War" (Episodes IV through VI for fans of the movie series), [_Star Wars: Commander_](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-commander/id847985808?mt=8) lets players take sides with the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire to lead familiar machines of war like AT-ATs and TIE fighters into battle.

Instead of the interactive, story-driven app [_Star Wars Scene Maker_](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/19/disneys-star-wars-scene-maker-lets-users-recreate-iconic-movie-scenes-on-their-ipad), or the exploration-style game [_Star Wars Journeys: The Phantom Menace_](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-journeys-phantom/id796726213?mt=8), _Star Wars: Commander_ is a blend of base defense and full-on assault game types. Interesting in-game mechanics like upgradable weapons and deployments join comics-inspired graphics to add to the game's style.

From the release notes:

*   Build and defend a base: Train unique troops specific to each faction, and fortify a base with deflector shields, turrets, heavy artillery, and other defenses.

*   Lead epic battles: Strategically deploy powerful armies, units, and vehicles against enemies and other players around the galaxy.

*   Travel to multiple planets and complete special missions: Play an all-new story as a valiant leader on the front lines of the Galactic Civil War.

*   Upgrade a strike team and its defenses: Strengthen forces with multiple levels of upgrades for each unit.

The app will be an iOS exclusive at launch and is Disney's third branded _Star Wars_ title since the company took over Lucasfilm, and thereby LucasArts, in 2012.

_Star Wars: Commander_ is available now as a [free 56.9MB download](http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-commander/id847985808?mt=8) from the iOS App Store.
