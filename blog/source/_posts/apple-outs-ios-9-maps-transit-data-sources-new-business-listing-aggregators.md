While Apple's Maps [attribution page](http://gspe21.ls.apple.com/html/attribution-5.html) shows a revision date of Jun. 4, 2015, _Apple Maps Marketing_ believes the transit sources are [indeed new](http://applemapsmarketing.com/2015/08/dac-group-position-technologies-now-feeding-business-listings-to-apple-maps/).

Apple announced earlier this year that transit directions will initially be available in Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Toronto, and Washington D.C., as well as 30 cities in China. The newly published list of providers gives a closer look at what to expect from transit assets in Canada, Germany, the U.S. and UK, including major cities like Berlin, London, New York, San Francisco and Toronto.
