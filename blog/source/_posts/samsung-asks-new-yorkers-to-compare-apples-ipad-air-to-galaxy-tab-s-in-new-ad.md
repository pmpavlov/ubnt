<span>In a new spot posted to its YouTube account on Friday, Samsung took to the streets of New York City and asked consumers to compare the Galaxy Tab S to the iPad Air, with the results predictably skewed in favor of the Samsung tablet.

Hosted by a wild-haired young man named Deval, the one minute and twenty-two second commercial invites people who are out-and-about to compare the slates primarily on physical features, like thinness and weight. "It's actually really light," says one man, and "this one's thinner," says another, referring to the Galaxy Tab S.

Displays are also briefly mentioned, with the Samsung spokesman saying the Galaxy Tab S boasts "almost 1 million more pixels" than the iPad. Comments range from "the resolution's awesome" to "Samsung makes the best screens in the world," said by one woman in a matter-of-fact manner.

Interestingly, one couple that appear to be carrying iPhones and verify that they "love tablets, all day" are shown in the ad's opening, but do not appear again. 

Samsung has altered its marketing strategy in recent months to point more directly at Apple, as the two companies fight for control of the mobile phone and tablet markets around the world. Previous Samsung ads have poked fun at Apple users waiting in line for a new iPhone release, for instance, and the company most recently [called out](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/22/samsung-ad-challenges-apples-iphone-5s-to-take-ice-bucket-challenge-) the iPhone 5s to take the ALS ice bucket challenge.
