OS X Yosemite Beta 2 is now available to download from the Mac App Store for members of the OS X Beta Program. The public release comes a few days after OS X Yosemite [Developer Preview 6](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/18/apple-releases-os-x-yosemite-developer-preview-6-xcode-6-beta-6) was issued to registered members of Apple's development community.

The first public beta of Yosemite arrived in [late July](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/24/apple-makes-first-os-x-yosemite-public-beta-available-on-the-mac-app-store), marking the first time members of the general public could officially test Apples next-generation Mac operating system. OS X Yosemite is scheduled to arrive this fall, and brings new connectivity options between Macs and mobile devices running the upcoming iOS 8 platform.

The release notes of OS X Yosemite Beta 2 do not offer any indications of what changes may be included. The listing on the Mac App Store simply states that the update "is recommended for all users."

iTunes 12, meanwhile, is identified as build 97, comes with a number of changes from the currently available media suite, most notably a streamlined design that Apple says makes browsing content libraries "easier and more enjoyable." iTunes 12 also features support for the "Family Sharing" function, allowing iTunes, iBooks and App Store purchases to be shared with up to six people in your family without sharing accounts.

Apple has also improved playlists in iTunes 12, allowing suers to view their full library and playlists side by side. And a redesigned "Get Info" window features a clean look that provides users with the most useful information about their media.
