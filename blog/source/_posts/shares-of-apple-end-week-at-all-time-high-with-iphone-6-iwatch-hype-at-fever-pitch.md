Shares of AAPL stock closed the day on Friday at $102.50, which is a new record. Intraday trading also reached $102.90.

The company's stock trended upward since Wednesday as anticipation builds for the its event now less than a week and a half away. Though the date had already leaked, Apple [made it official](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/28/apple-announces-sept-9-event-for-expected-iphone-6-iwatch-unveiling-wish-we-could-say-more) on Thursday, sending out invitations to members of the press for a Sept. 9 event in Cupertino, Calif.

The company is widely expected to use the event to formally unveil its next-generation "iPhone 6," as well as an all-new wearable "iWatch." Wall Street is particularly excited about the next iPhone, as Apple's hot selling handsets account for the lion's share of the company's profits.

Less certain is how a so-called "iWatch" might affect the company's bottom line, but investors may have to wait to find out: Though Apple's wearable device is expected to be revealed Sept. 9, the latest rumors suggest the device [may not be ready](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/29/apples-wearable-iwatch-not-expected-to-ship-until-early-2015) to launch until early 2015.

Apple's current trading price has the company's market capitalization valued at $613.76 billion, which remains well behind its highest-ever market capitalization of over $665 billion. Apple's gains have also seen it nearly double its value from a 52-week low of $63.89, which occurred in September of 2013.

The company crossed the $100 threshold [on Aug. 19](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/19/shares-of-apple-reach-highest-ever-closing-price-as-iphone-6-iwatch-hype-builds), reaching levels the company had not seen since its previous all-time high in 2012, ahead of the iPhone 5 launch.
