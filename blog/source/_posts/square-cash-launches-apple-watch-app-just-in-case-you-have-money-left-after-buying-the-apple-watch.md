I don’t carry cash anymore. Ever. Sometimes I get caught in a situation where I need it, mostly when I want to tip someone. I use either a credit card or Apple Pay to pay for things, and I send money to people I know using Square Cash, almost exclusively.

If you have any money left over from buying an Apple Watch, you can now send it to friends and family using Square Cash from your wrist.

The company tells me it took the smaller screen on the watch as an opportunity to do something fun and “streamline” the process — the stacks of cash graphic.

Square Cash, which [first surfaced two years ago](http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/square-cash-will-let-you-send-money-to-your-friends-by-email/), is Square’s answer to services like Venmo, which let you quickly send money to anyone you want. In Square’s case, there’s no fee and it hits the other person’s bank account immediately if they’re signed up too.

[Using a “Cashtag,”](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/23/businesstime-for-square-cash/) you can send money to someone without having to know their phone number, email address or other personal information. It’s your username on Square Cash.

Square tells me that people are using the service to do everything from collect money for their honeymoon or accept donations for their charities. But honestly, flinging someone $20 from your wrist sounds like something a douchey Apple Watch wearer would do.
