Sood, who is well known for digging into Apple code, said he was able to [roll his own](https://twitter.com/hamzasood/status/633752345856229376) watch face source code, complete with customizable color schemes, up and running on his Apple Watch after some "haxx." 

The result, seen below, is a custom animated watch face playing the "Onoz Omg" meme against a psychedelic flashing background. Sood is able to change the background's two primary colors using Apple's watch face customization user interface, activated by a force press.

Sood posted the custom watch face source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hamzasood/CustomWatchFaceTest) and works with Apple Watch units running watchOS 2\. 

Apple is expected to launch watchOS 2 this fall with a [slew of new features](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/08/apple-reveals-watchos-2-3rd-party-complications-nightstand-mode-native-apps-more) including support for native third-party apps and complications, a nightstand mode, enhanced Siri functionality and Activation Lock, among others. Custom watch face support is not on the list.
