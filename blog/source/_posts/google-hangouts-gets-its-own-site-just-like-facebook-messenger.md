Everyone wants to be free and standalone. Remember when [Facebook Messenger got its own site](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/facebook-messenger-desktop/) that maybe people use but we’re not sure because they don’t talk about it?

Google Hangouts [wanted some of that action](https://plus.google.com/+JordannaChord/posts/fggYXgnfu4K), too. Starting today you can go to [http://hangouts.google.com](http://hangouts.google.com) to make a phone call or ping a friend:

Interestingly enough, the product hasn’t broken away from the Google domain yet. It doesn’t even own Hangouts.com. [Domain names aren’t a strong suit of Google.](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/10/google-is-now-alphabet-but-it-doesnt-own-alphabet-com/)

Yes, this is also part of the breaking away that Google+ services are going through, joining [the Photos product](http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/google-photos-breaks-free-of-google-now-offers-free-unlimited-storage/) in all of its “standalone” glory. I use Hangouts in Gmail on the desktop, but I might switch over. Having a big old call button is actually kind of handy.

This is also, of course, a massive branding exercise for Google. It wants to build powerful brands to compete with other micro-products coming out of Facebook, Microsoft and Snapchat. Google has Photos and Hangouts, Facebook has Instagram and Messenger and Snapchat is coming on strong with Stories.
